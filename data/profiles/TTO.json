The country occupies an area of 5,128 square kilometers with a population of 1.3 million people, predominantly middle-class. It is a stable, democratic and highly diverse society (in terms of ethnicity, religion and culture). The country consists of two main islands: Trinidad, the larger and more populous island, and Tobago, a smaller island which only comprises six percent of the nation&rsquo;s land area and four percent of the population. Unlike many other Caribbean nations, the island has a relatively large industrial base. It is the largest producer of oil and gas in the Caribbean and its economy is dependent on its energy supplies; it is also the fifth largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world. The oil and gas sector contributes 46 percent of the nation&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), followed by financial services (11 percent), distribution and restaurants (11 percent), petrochemical manufacturing (5 percent), and other activities. Tourism contributes a much smaller portion of GDP to the nation&rsquo;s economy than other Caribbean nations, at around 1 percent. The per capita income of the country is approximately US$18,864 per year.</p><p>It is predicted that climate change will result in an increased frequency of extreme events such as storms and hurricanes. In the First National Communication for Trinidad and Tobago of 30 November 2001 it is noted that climatic change needs to be factored into water management strategies, drought management and flood damage reduction programs. Other vulnerable sectors are the coastal resources, agriculture, forestry, health, and food security. Adaptation measures will be required for these sectors too.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Trinidad and Tobago is a high-income country, one of the most industrialized in the Commonwealth Caribbean. On the 2015 Human Development Index scale, Trinidad and Tobago ranked 64th out of the 188 highly developed countries, with a value of 0.772, above the regional value of 0.748 for Latin America and the Caribbean. </p><p>Trinidad and Tobago has submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and has developed a carbon-reduction strategy. Energy efficiency needs focus to reduce carbon emissions, particularly since Trinidad and Tobago was ranked the least energy-efficient of 14 Caribbean states in 2013. 43% of households in Trinidad and Tobago have an energy consumption level on par with North American households, twice the level of an average European household and three times the global average. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Challenges in addressing poverty and inequality persist and may increase due to the worsening economic situation, which is reducing the fiscal space for undertaking social protection. According to the Survey of Living Conditions, 2005, 16.7% of households were classified &lsquo;poor&rsquo; and 1.2 per cent lived in extreme poverty. The linkage between poverty and inequality is substantial, with poverty, joblessness and exclusion disproportionately affecting vulnerable groups &ndash; particularly female-headed households, at-risk urban youth and the rural poor. The root causes of poverty and inequality are multiple and self-reinforcing, going beyond income access challenges to include: (a) sub-optimal safety nets; (b) high insecurity; (c) limited civic participation; (d) absence of restorative justice approaches; and (e) cultural elements linked to gender relations, male underperformance in schools, and gender-based violence.</p><p>Regarding adaptation to climate change, while Trinidad and Tobago does not regularly experience national-level disasters there has been an increase in the intensity and duration of hydro-meteorological events. Situated on the Caribbean tectonic plate, the country is at relatively high risk of seismic activity and man-made hazards.</p><p>Access to development finance is rather limited since Trinidad and Tobago is a high-income country. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "72", "title": "Skilled labour force ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "77.3", "title": "Internet user percent of population", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "13", "title": "Spent in school on average", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "73.5", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "0.6", "title": "Population in multidimensional poverty", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "0.772", "title": "Human development index", "unit": ""}, {"value": "1.2", "title": "Households in extreme poverty", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "58.3", "title": "Employment to population ratio ", "unit": "% ages 15 and older"}]}
