The nation comprises four states &ndash; Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae &ndash; all of which are located approximately 2,900 kilometers north of eastern Australia. The mainstays of the Micronesian economy are subsistence farming and fishing; the country also possesses high-grade deposits of phosphate. Complicated land tenure systems, a reliance on imported food and water during times of stress, lack of national planning, limited resourcing, and the remote nature of the islands make climate change a serious threat to all forms of development in FSM.</p><p>FSM is among the least urbanized in the Pacific and most Micronesians live on or near the coast. A third of Micronesians live below the basic needs poverty line and poverty has increased in three out of four states in the past decade. FSM&rsquo;s economy is aid dependent with a rising trade deficit, due to increasing demand for imported food, clothing, and consumer goods. Migration and a low fertility rate have resulted in negative population growth. Young people aged 10-14 are the single largest demographic group and face limited employment opportunities. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Between 2000 and 2019, Micronesia (Federated States of)&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.546 to 0.620, an increase of 13.6 percent.

Micronesia (Federated States of)&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 11.3 percent between 1990 and 2019. </p><p>In 2003, FSM completed a 20-year strategic development plan, an output of the 3rd FSM Economic Summit that reflected the inputs of over 400 participants representing a broad range of perspectives including government, traditional leaders, industry and civil society. The sustained growth strategy encapsulated in the plan focuses on macro-economic stability; good governance; outward-oriented, private sector-led economy; human resource development (improved health and education services); investment in infrastructure; and long-term environmental sustainability. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>FSM has limited natural resources, and exports are heavily concentrated on its marine resources. Most of FSM&rsquo;s commodities (esp. petroleum products and a very high proportion of food) are imported, and this import dependency exposes the country to global economic shocks and price spikes. Like other Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) petroleum fuels are largely used for electricity generation and transportation. Transport fuel is mostly used for marine services since land transportation is modest given FSM&rsquo;s small landmass in each occupied island and the general lack of major commercial land based economic based activities.</p><p>FSM has a mixed record on promoting gender equality, despite ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Women have the highest rate of unemployment in the country, whereas there are currently no women national Members of Parliament. One in three women report experience of gender-based violence.</p><p>Environmental, social and economic factors, including limited land access and productive resources, have increased human mobility, including internal migration. Urbanization and the creation of informal settlements have led to new forms of hardship and scant access to public services.</p><p>There is little tourism in the area due to lack of access and facilities. &nbsp;Each state has considerable autonomy within the federation and has devised its own strategy for development. &nbsp;However, FSM&#39;s geographical isolation and poorly developed infrastructure in general are major impediments to its long-term growth. Regarding the effects of global warming, the FSM is particularly vulnerable to accelerated sea-level rise and longer-lasting El Nino droughts.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "67.9\n", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "11.5\n", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "100.9", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "35.3", "title": "Internet users, total ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "65.0", "title": "Skilled labour force", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "78.7\n", "title": "Rural population with access to electricity ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "20.7", "title": "Mobile phone subscriptions ", "unit": ""}, {"value": "18.2", "title": "Female share of employment in senior and middle management ", "unit": "%"}]}
