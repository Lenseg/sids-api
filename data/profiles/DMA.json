With GDP standing at US$517million, the Dominica economy reflects many of the traditional features of a small open economy. The open economy includes a high level of dependence on external trade, reliance on single sector export products (in agriculture), tourism revenue, and dependence on foreign capital for investment into productive sectors and infrastructural development.</p><p>Dominica is on its way to becoming the first climate-resilient nation in the world. An extensive national protected areas system constitutes a significant carbon sink and protects approximately 20% of the national territory. In addition, the island is moving towards ecotourism, as it markets its unique environment and culture. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Dominica&#39;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.742&mdash; which puts the country in the high human development category.

Dominica&#39;s national priority is to enhance community, ecosystem and national resilience to climate change and natural disasters. This includes implementing viable, sustainable energy and other mitigation measures, which reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels while building capacity and self-sufficiency&mdash;in this regard, harnessing the country&#39;s geothermal resources over the next decade. As a result, it will liberate considerable resources spent on fuel imports which can be redirected to priority adaptation measures to build resilience in vulnerable communities and sectors. Furthermore, the continued expansion of Dominica&#39;s geothermal resources from 2025 onwards will enable the country to export significant amounts of renewable energy to nearby countries, contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The island is in a vulnerable position economically, socially, culturally, and environmentally. Economic development, in particular, is significantly affected by both natural and man-made external factors, as is increasingly evidenced by the negative impact on the local economy of changes associated with such international phenomena as globalization and trade liberalization. </p><p>Dominica is vulnerable to current and ongoing impacts from climate change. Much of Dominica&#39;s essential infrastructures are located along the coastline, close to the present sea level; this makes them vulnerable to flooding and storms. Furthermore, 90% of the population is dispersed among coastal villages, with the main population centre, Roseau, located along the leeward coast. Temperature changes due to climate change affect a range of species, water flow in watersheds, reduced food availability for wildlife and increased forest pests, disease and vulnerability to extreme climate events. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "11,884", "title": "Gross national income per capita", "unit": "PPP$"}, {"value": "139.8", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "2.5", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita", "unit": "Tonnes"}, {"value": "57.4", "title": "Forest area", "unit": "% of total land area"}, {"value": "58.9", "title": "Ocean Health Index: Clean Waters score (worst 0\u2013100 best)", "unit": "-"}, {"value": "13", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": "12.7", "title": "People affected by disasters", "unit": "per 100,000 pupulation"}, {"value": "38", "title": "Protected marine area ", "unit": "km"}]}
