Dominica is volcanic in origin and is characterized by very rugged and steep terrain with approximately ninety miles of coastline. The country is known as the &lsquo;Nature Isle of the Caribbean&rsquo; and is lush with rivers and rainforests, and home to an expansive array of flora and fauna. 60% of the land area of the country is covered by vegetation. The country&rsquo;s main economic sectors are rain-fed agriculture, government services, banks and insurance, wholesale and retail trade, and transport. Agricultural production accounted for 12.2% of total GDP. With GDP standing at US$517million, the Dominica economy reflects many of the traditional features of a small open economy. This includes a high level of dependence on external trade as a proportion of GDP, dependence on single sector export products (in this case agriculture) and tourism revenue, high levels of underemployment and unemployment, and dependence on foreign capital for investment into productive sectors and for infrastructural development.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Dominica&rsquo;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.742&mdash; which puts the country in the high human development category. Between 1990 and 2019, Dominica&rsquo;s life expectancy at birth increased by 2.6 years, and mean years of schooling increased by 0.4 years. Dominica&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 53.5 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>Dominica is on its way to becoming the first climate-resilient nation of the world. An extensive system of national protected areas constitutes a significant carbon sink and provides protection for approximately 20% of the national territory. The island is moving towards tourism/ecotourism, as it markets its unique environment and culture. </p><p>Dominica has established a strong track record on climate change adaptation, and in this regard was one of the first countries in the Caribbean region to adopt a National Climate Change Adaptation Policy. Dominica&#39;s national priority is to enhance community, ecosystem and national resilience to climate change and natural disasters, including through the implementation of viable sustainable energy and other mitigation measures, which reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels, while building local resilience, capacity and self-sufficiency. In this regard, the harnessing of the country&rsquo;s geothermal resources over the next decade will considerably reduce Dominica&rsquo;s reliance on imported fossil fuels and will liberate considerable resources spent on fuel imports which can be directed to priority adaptation measures to build resilience in vulnerable communities and sectors. Continued expansion of Dominica&rsquo;s geothermal resources from 2025 onwards will enable the country to export significant amounts of renewable energy to nearby countries, thereby contributing to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The island is in a vulnerable position economically, socially, culturally, and environmentally. Economic development, in particular, is significantly affected by both natural and man-made external factors as is increasingly evidenced by the negative impact on the local economy of changes associated with such international phenomena as globalization and trade liberalization. </p><p>Dominica is vulnerable to current and ongoing impacts from climate change. As much of Dominica&#39;s important infrastructure is located along the coastline, close to the present sea level, this makes them vulnerable to flooding and storms. Furthermore, 90% of the population is dispersed among coastal villages, with the main population center, Roseau, located along the leeward coast. &nbsp;Temperature changes due to climate change affect range of species, water flow in watersheds, reduced food availability for wildlife and increased forest pests, disease and vulnerability to extreme climate events. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "11,884", "title": "Gross national income per capita", "unit": "PPP$"}, {"value": "139.8", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "2.5", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita", "unit": "Tonnes"}, {"value": "57.4", "title": "Forest area", "unit": "% of total land area"}, {"value": "58.9", "title": "Ocean Health Index: Clean Waters score (worst 0\u2013100 best)", "unit": "-"}, {"value": "13", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": "12.7", "title": "People affected by disasters", "unit": "per 100,000 pupulation"}, {"value": "38", "title": "Protected marine area ", "unit": "km"}]}
