About sixty percent of the island&rsquo;s bedrock is white limestone; twenty five percent is volcanic and cretaceous, ten percent alluvial and five percent yellow limestone. More than 120 rivers flow from the mountains to the coast. The coastline is approximately 1,022 kilometers. </p><p>Jamaica is the largest English-speaking island in the Caribbean and the third-largest island in the Greater Antilles. It derives its name from Xaymaca, &lsquo;Land of Wood and Water&rsquo;. The capital city Kingston is home to over 571,000 people. As a small island developing state which is heavily reliant on its natural resources, Jamaica is also prone to a number of natural hazards, and the threats posed by these hazards are exacerbated by climate change. The country also faces challenges in the sustainable management of its environmental resources. </p><p>Jamaica&rsquo;s economy is dependent on the services sector (including tourism), which constitutes approximately 60 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP); remittances make up a further 20 percent of the country&rsquo;s GDP. Jamaica has a high unemployment rate and the fourth highest debt to GDP ratio per capita in the world. Approximately 65 percent of the country&rsquo;s workforce is employed by the services sector, 17 percent by industry (bauxite, gypsum, etc.) and 18 percent in agriculture.</p><p>While the country is over 90 percent dependent on imported fossil fuels to meet its energy demands, resulting in relatively high costs reflected in the cost per KWh and in the amount of money that the country spends on energy, Jamaica&rsquo;s attempts to explore renewable energy sources could be strengthened by helping to address financial and regulatory barriers. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Jamaica&rsquo;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.734&mdash; which put the country in the high human development category.

For the coastal zone there is a need for advanced planning to avoid worst impacts, assessments of need for modification of land use and implementation of identified land use guidelines, modification of building styles and codes, and a withdrawal of Government subsidies for development in high risk areas. In addition, there needs to be more structured coral reef management and greater support for research and environmental monitoring.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "19.9", "title": "Poverty rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "9319", "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "87", "title": "Literacy rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "~100", "title": "Enrollment in primary school", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "75.8", "title": "Life expectancy", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "93", "title": "Sustainable access to improved drinking water sources", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "87.3", "title": "National dept to GDP ratio", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "20", "title": "Infant mortality rates", "unit": "per 1,000"}]}
