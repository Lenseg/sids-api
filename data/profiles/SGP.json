From its history as a transshipment port, Singapore has a highly developed market economy which is considered to be innovative and dynamic, resulting in significant foreign investment, leading to a ranking as the most competitive economy by the World Economic forum. Diversification is at the heart of Singapore&rsquo;s Economy with bases in finance, trade and transportation. In 2019, the industry made up approximately a quarter of the country&rsquo;s GDP while the rest was covered by the services sector with service exports (mainly manufactured goods, electronics and machinery) amounting to almost twice the GDP.</p><p>Singapore supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It presented its first Voluntary National Review (VNR) report to the 2018 High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. &nbsp;The VNR process was co-led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and took stock of progress on sustainable development.

Singapore&rsquo;s GNI per capita also increased by about 137.8 percent between 1990 and 2019. Singapore has also made strides in gender equality with &nbsp;a GII value of 0.065, ranking it 12 out of 162 countries in the 2019 index. 23.0 percent of the country&rsquo;s parliamentary seats are held by women, and 78.1 percent of adult women have reached at least a secondary level of education compared to 85.1 percent of their male counterparts.
