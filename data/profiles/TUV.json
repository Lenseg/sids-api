The country rarely exceeds 3 metres above mean sea level. At its widest point, Tuvalu only spans about 200 meters. </p><p>Classified as a least-developed country, the islands contain very few natural resources. &nbsp;The primary economic&nbsp;activities of the country are subsistence farming and fishing; income from foreign aid is an important part of the economy. &nbsp;</p><p>Poverty has increased in the last decade, particularly in urban areas. Tuvalu is classified as a Least Developed Country (LDC), but has met the threshold for graduation to developing country status based on its human development indicators and high per capita income.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Life expectancy and adult literacy are comparatively high for the region. Tuvalu has achieved gender parity in primary education although there is some concern that fewer boys are accessing secondary and tertiary education levels. </p><p>In the last 10 years Tuvalu has sold use of their Internet domain &ldquo;.tv&rdquo;&mdash;an action that contributes a substantial&nbsp;amount of revenue to their overall Gross Domestic Product.</p><p>The country&rsquo;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers an area of approximately 900,000 square kilometers and is rich in oceanic fish stocks. The Government offers fishing licenses for foreign fishing companies to operate their fishing vessels within the EEZ. Tuvalu has received a substantial amount of money from these fishing licenses. In 2008, Tuvalu Fisheries resources within this area also offered potential for upgrading the country&rsquo;s small-scale fishing to meet the local demand for fish. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The country faces countless development challenges; from its remote geographical location in the vast ocean of the South Pacific, to its lack of natural resources and limited human capacity.&nbsp;Tuvalu has few exports and depends on revenues from fishing license fees, overseas remittances, dividends from the Tuvalu Trust Fund, and income from rent of the &ldquo;dot tv&rdquo; Internet extension. Around three quarters of the labour force works in the informal economy, primarily subsistence farming and fishing. Most of the islands are built on coral and are not suitable for crop production beyond household needs. Underemployment, particularly of young people, is fuelling urbanisation of the capital, Funafuti.</p><p>Due to its low-lying geography, Tuvalu is at acute risk from natural disasters, including rising storm surges, cyclones, and tsunamis. Seawater infiltration has already increased soil salinity, limiting the range of plants that can be grown on the islands. Increased water temperatures and ocean acidification have affected coral ecosystems that serve as fish nurseries, making it harder for Tuvaluans to catch and eat fish. Groundwater resources are no longer suitable for human consumption due to pollution from saltwater intrusion. Coastal erosion is a major problem in Tuvalu, particularly on the western side of the islands. As most Tuvaluans live within coastal areas, additional stress is being placed on the already vulnerable marine ecosystem. Rising sea temperatures are also contributing to coral bleaching and decreasing marine productivity. The marine ecosystem is a vital component of Tuvalu&rsquo;s economy which is dependent on revenue provided by tuna fishing.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "47.0", "title": "GDP per capita (2021)", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": "6.3", "title": "GDP growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "6.3", "title": "Seats held by women in national parliaments", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "108.7", "title": "Primary gross enrolment ratio", "unit": "per 1000 "}, {"value": "1.2", "title": "Population growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "19.0", "title": "Health: Current expenditure", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "12.0", "title": "International trade: exports", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": "33.3", "title": "Forested area\u00a0", "unit": "% of land area"}]}
