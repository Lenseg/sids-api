Palau covers an area of 460 sq. km, and has a population of 18,008 people. More than 70% of the population live on the commercial hub of Koror Island, resulting in issues of overcrowding and water insecurity. </p><p>Palau&rsquo;s economy has performed well in recent years, and is reliant on development assistance, external grants, and food imports. The national economy is dominated by the public sector and tourism supplemented by agriculture, fisheries, and a fledgling aquaculture industry. Migratory fish constitute the only export of significant value. </p><p>As with many small island developing states, Palau has had little if anything to do with causing global climate change, but is left to now cope with the consequences. The country faces worsening droughts, and coastal inundation which can contaminate groundwater resources, resulting in water shortages that have significant economic and social impacts. &nbsp;Rural communities and households are particularly vulnerable. Priority needs in Palau include food security, nutrition and livelihoods; continued education for girls and boys; and protecting women and girls at increased risk of gender-based violence.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Palau&rsquo;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.826&mdash; which put the country in the very high human development category&mdash;</p><p>positioning it at 50 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 2000 and 2019, Palau&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.744 to 0.826, an increase of 11.0 percent. Between 1990 and 2019, Palau&rsquo;s life expectancy at birth increased by 11.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 2.2 years and expected years of schooling increased by 2.1 years. Palau&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 45.9 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>The standard of living in Palau is among the highest in the Pacific, with well-established health and education services. Palau has well-developed health and education infrastructures and in recent years has created a strong environmental protection infrastructure. Efforts currently aim at improving Palau&#39;s resilience capacity in preparing and mitigating man-made, geo-physical, climate hazards and other related hazards. Palau has taken concrete action to leave no one behind in its disaster risk management efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Multidimensional poverty is high across many countries due to geographic remoteness and lack of access to basic services. Environmental, social and economic factors, including limited land access and productive resources, have increased human mobility, including internal migration. Urbanization and the creation of informal settlements have led to new forms of hardship and scant access to public services. The long-term average growth rate for Palau is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1%. The economic costs of disasters will continue to detract from growth, with average losses falling between 0.5 and 6.6% of GDP annually.</p><p>Palau has a mixed record on promoting gender equality and has not ratified The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Palauan society is matrilineal and women have always held positions of power and respect. However, women remain under-represented in the national congress, cabinet and senior leadership positions. A quarter of women have reported experience of gender-based violence.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "73.9", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": ""}, {"value": "123.3", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "13.2", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita ", "unit": "tons"}, {"value": "92.5", "title": "Skilled labour force ", "unit": ""}, {"value": "87.6", "title": "Forest area", "unit": ""}, {"value": "28.2", "title": "Net official development assistance received ", "unit": ""}, {"value": "6.379", "title": "Homeless people due to natural disaster", "unit": ""}, {"value": "", "title": "", "unit": ""}]}
