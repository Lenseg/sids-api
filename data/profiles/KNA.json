Within the last few years, there has been substantial expansion of the tourism sector, additional cruise ports, hotels, national events and attractions; creating livelihoods across the island.

The Federation is vulnerable to existing climatic conditions, particularly droughts and hurricanes, and will need to build national capacity to respond to the challenges presented by global climate change.</p><p>Pressure for agricultural land has caused small farmers to clear forested plots along slopes for farming, causing deforestation, soil erosion and water pollution. In KNA water resources are vulnerable to sea level rise and temperature increase leading to higher evaporation rates. Given the centrality of ground water sources to the national water supply, the problem of water resources is primarily one of keeping and protecting the underground water resources.
