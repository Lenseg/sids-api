Basseterre is the capital located on the larger island of Saint Kitts, and Charlestown is the capital of the smaller island of Nevis, which is located 2 miles away across a shallow channel called The Narrows. The islands are the summits of a submerged mountain range along the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Tectonic Plate. Most of the islands&rsquo; inhabitants live near the coastline, as the interior tends to be extremely rugged and steep. The country has a high literacy rate of 97.8 per cent and a low unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. Per capita, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2006 was US$8,546.</p><p>The islands carry on small-scale crops, including rice, yams, bananas and cotton. However, pressure for agricultural land has caused small farmers to clear forested plots along slopes for farming, causing deforestation, soil erosion and water pollution. The national priorities in Saint Kitts and Nevis indicate an emphasis on the tourism sector as the engine of economic growth. Within the last few years, there has been a substantial industry expansion, additional cruise ports, hotels, national events and attractions. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Saint Kitts and Nevis&rsquo; HDI value for 2019 is 0.779, putting the country in the high human development category.

In addition, initiatives in other national strategic plans support efforts to bolster the tourism industry. This focus promotes community-based tourism, conserves biodiversity, and creates livelihoods. </p><p>The Department of Environment embarked on community awareness training to stimulate action on reforestation and the restoration of biodiversity. In addition, the Department of Marine Resources introduced legislation (Fisheries, Aquaculture and Marine Resources Act of 2016) to support activities that develop an aquaculture environment, increase fish production and address ocean pollution. &nbsp;</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The efforts to diversify the economy are severely restricted by constraints of market size, limited natural resources, and high production costs.

Therefore, it will need to build national capacity to respond to the challenges presented by global climate change.</p><p>Pressure for agricultural land has caused small farmers to clear forested plots along slopes for farming, causing deforestation, soil erosion and water pollution. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, water resources are vulnerable to sea-level rise and temperature increase, leading to higher evaporation rates. Given the centrality of groundwater sources to the national water supply, protecting the underground water resources is primarily one of keeping. </p><p>Waste Management continues to be a growing concern.
