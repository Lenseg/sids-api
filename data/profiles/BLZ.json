Total national territory (including territorial sea) is 46,620 sq. km. Belize is a small Central American state with a long, low-lying coastline which is vulnerable to natural disasters through tropical cyclones and flooding. Three-quarters of its land is covered by forests that support fragile ecosystems. The country lies in the hurricane belt and, on average, is affected by a hurricane every three years. These hurricanes have adversely affected the people and economy of Belize, as demonstrated by the damage to its agriculture sector in late 2007 and late 2010. Following the threat posed by Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, there has been a review of hurricane preparedness and procedures to mitigate the effects of natural disasters. The scenario of a major disaster such as Hurricane Mitch, and more recently hurricanes Keith and Iris, has served to sensitize the government and general public to climate change issues, mitigation, and especially adaptation.</p><p>Belize is an upper-middle-income country with a GDP per capita of $8,486 in 2014. Tourism, agriculture and fishery drive the country&rsquo;s economic growth. The country&rsquo;s agriculture sector generates 71 percent of its foreign exchange earnings and employs about 29 percent of its labor force. Key export crops include citrus, sugar, bananas and marine products (such as shrimp). However, Belize&rsquo;s largest source of foreign exchange is tourism&mdash;a sector of the economy that the government has designated as being a priority for further development.</p><p>The Government of Belize prioritizes poverty reduction and sustainable human development within its long term development agenda. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1, &ldquo;End Poverty in all its forms everywhere,&rdquo; is the central point that anchors the other SDG pillars. This goal is aligned with other national development planning frameworks, including Horizon 2030&mdash;the National Development Framework for Belize between 2010 and 2030&mdash;and the newly endorsed Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy for Belize (GSDS) 2016-2020.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Belize&rsquo;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.716&mdash; which put the country in the high human development category. Between 1990 and 2019, Belize&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.610 to 0.716, an increase of 17.4 percent. </p><p>Between 1990 and 2019, Belize&rsquo;s life expectancy at birth increased by 3.4 years, mean years of schooling increased by 4.1 years and expected years of schooling increased by 2.3 years. Belize&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 36.5 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>Because of recent advances in the health sector, such as a reduction in maternal deaths and an increase in child survival, Belize is positioned to build on that momentum and increase access to and efficiency of basic public healthcare services. The Belize Health Sector Strategic Plan for 2014 to 2024 outlines the steps the government and its partners will take to provide &ldquo;efficient and equitable health services&rdquo; to citizens. </p><p>Belize has recently launched the National Digital Agenda 2022-2025 through its E-Governance and Digitalization Unit, which focuses on embracing digital transformation to support government and civil society by improving services and key infrastructure.</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Although long-term growth performance in Belize has been positive, there have been signs of economic stagnation over the past decade. Inequality is high, as seen by the increase in the GINI coefficient from 40 percent (2002) to 53.1 percent (2013). Poverty is increasing, and 2013 estimates suggested that 41 percent of the country&#39;s population lives below poverty. High levels of unemployment&mdash;10.2 percent in 2015&mdash;exacerbate poverty, with women and youth disproportionately affected. Figures from 2015 suggested that women are twice as likely to be underemployed (one-fifth of all employed women) compared to 10%t of their male counterparts. Nationwide, over 40 percent of out-of-school youth aged 15 to 24 are employed.</p><p>Poverty and poor institutional capacities undermine citizen security in Belize, particularly in urban centres. Belize has the fourth-highest homicide rate per capita worldwide, with 40 homicides for every 100,000 residents. The overall crime rate in Belize City increased in 2014. Furthermore, increased violence against women threatens women&#39;s safety, which is evidenced by the high demand for related legal assistance.</p><p>Worsening crime rates and violence are eroding the quality of life for citizens and hampering the country&#39;s prospects for social and economic development. A 2011 Enterprise Survey showed that over 50 percent of companies in Belize believed crime, theft, and unrest were major impediments to their businesses. The Belize tourism industry, which provides 25 percent of the country&#39;s jobs, considers crime the biggest threat to development in the sector.</p><p>Due to the country&#39;s reliance on natural capital&mdash;and because a large segment of the population (52 percent) and businesses are concentrated along the coast&mdash;Belize is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Climate-related disasters have caused extensive damage to critical infrastructure and agriculture in recent years. Natural disasters have caused budgetary deficits as the Government of Belize has increased spending to repair and rebuild damaged infrastructure.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "4.1", "title": "Increase in expected years of schooling from 1990 to 2019", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "36.5", "title": "Increase in GNI per capita from 1990 to 2019", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "40", "title": "Employed out-of-school youth from 15 to 24 ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "25", "title": "Jobs in tourism industry", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "54", "title": "Service sector and tourism industry proportion of GDP", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "74.6", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "13.1", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "43.5", "title": "Skilled labor force", "unit": "%"}]}
