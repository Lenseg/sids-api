Despite the arid climate and mountainous terrain, Cabo Verde has been developing rapidly, in a large part thanks to its flourishing tourism industry, graduating from a least developed to a middle-income country in 2007. As a small island development state (SIDS), Cabo Verde, a very small emitter of GHG emissions, is disproportionately vulnerable to external economic shocks and extreme climatic events that can instantly erase years, if not decades of development gains.</p><p>Cabo Verde is a politically stable democracy with a population at 537,660 for 2017, with 49.8 percent female and 28.6 percent under 14 years of age. Despite &nbsp;its &nbsp;impressive &nbsp;development &nbsp;performance, &nbsp;Cabo Verde &nbsp;faces &nbsp;important challenges &nbsp;to &nbsp;achieving &nbsp;the &nbsp;SDGs, &nbsp;with &nbsp;inequality &nbsp;one &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;country&rsquo;s &nbsp;greatest challenges: 35.6 percent of Cabo Verdeans are poor and 10.6 percent extremely poor. Cabo Verde ranks sixth in sub-Saharan Africa on the Human Development Index, but when adjusted for inequality, it is lower. The Gini coefficient (estimated at 0.46 for 2015) has remained essentially unchanged for eight years.</p><p>Uneven &nbsp;economic &nbsp;development, &nbsp;particularly &nbsp;in &nbsp;tourism, &nbsp;has &nbsp;led &nbsp;to &nbsp;regional variations &nbsp;in &nbsp;poverty &nbsp;rates, &nbsp;human &nbsp;development &nbsp;and &nbsp;employment &nbsp;access. &nbsp;Some municipalities face poverty rates in excess of 60 per cent while others only 8 per cent. Urban areas have a higher number of poor residents but poverty is more widespread and &nbsp;deeper &nbsp;in &nbsp;rural &nbsp;areas &nbsp;and &nbsp;higher &nbsp;among &nbsp;women &nbsp;(53 &nbsp;per &nbsp;cent), &nbsp;in &nbsp;single &nbsp;parent households (44 per cent) and in households with six or more people (61 per cent).</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Cabo Verde is an African model of democracy, stability and share of the population with access to education (93% enrolment 2018), water (86%, 2018) and electricity (92.2%, 2019) which has made the Sustainable Development Goals the backbone of its economic, social and cultural planning. With significant support from the United Nations in Cabo Verde and other development partners, national authorities presented the Strategic Plan for Sustainable Development (PEDS) 2017-2021, resulting from a participatory process that lays the foundation for sustainable development in Cabo Verde to build a better future for all. The PEDS is in line with the 2030 Agenda principles and the Sustainable Development Goals.

As a consequence, the archipelago faces severe adaptation challenges associated with, among others, water resource scarcity, food and energy security. The access to affordable and sustainably-sourced energy and water, the protection of the islands&rsquo; delicate unique biodiversity and soils, sustainable development and the deployment of socio-ecological resilience within the planetary boundaries are a matter not just of policy choice but of survival.</p><p>Cabo Verde is also facing significant capacity constraints, limited fiscal space and insufficient domestic finance to respond adequately to challenges posed by climate change. This has been compounded by the economic fallout of the COVID 19 global pandemic and exacerbating the already existing high debt to GDP ratio. Although Cabo Verde has made remarkable progress in poverty reduction over the last decade, poverty remains widespread (35% of the population as recently as 2015). The COVID 19 pandemic has caused the biggest recession in Cabo Verde&rsquo;s modern history affecting virtually all economic sectors, including notably tourism, which is of strategic importance. While Cabo Verde&rsquo;s islands are in no way self-sufficient &ndash; the vast majority of goods, including essential foods, are imported. People are exceedingly vulnerable to shocks in supply chains caused by economic or digital disruptions, extreme weather events, or most recently the COVID 19 pandemic.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "126", "title": "Human Development Index ranking", "unit": "#"}, {"value": "148.1\n", "title": "Public Debt", "unit": "In % GDP "}, {"value": "-9.7", "title": "Public Deficit", "unit": "In % GDP "}, {"value": "", "title": "", "unit": ""}, {"value": "24", "title": "Conditional emissions reduction target by 2030", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "95.5", "title": "Access to electricity ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "10.6", "title": "Living in extreme poverty", "unit": "%"}]}
