Twenty-two of the atolls and four of the islands are inhabited. The combination of small land areas and low land elevations contributes to the ecological vulnerability in the Republic. There is concern that any change in sea-level could seriously upset the fragile balance between the land and the sea. Isolated by ocean, the Republic is more than 2,000 miles (3230km) from the nearest trading centers, Honolulu and Tokyo. Subsistence agriculture and fishing are the country&rsquo;s main industry; the tourism industry makes a noteworthy contribution along with development funds from the United States.</p><p>RMI is a large-ocean state with a total land area of only 182 square kilometers, spread across over two million square kilometers of ocean. As with many small island developing states, the RMI has had little if anything to do with causing global climate change, but is left to now cope with the consequences. The country faces worsening droughts, and coastal inundation which can contaminate groundwater resources, resulting in water shortages that have significant economic and social impacts. &nbsp;Rural communities and households are particularly vulnerable.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Interventions have been made to ensure climate resilient water security in outer atolls and islands of RMI by Improving existing rainwater harvesting systems for community buildings and households in outer islands and atolls for usage during increasing frequency and periods of drought. Moreover, RMI implemented the optimization of alternative water sources in order to reduce reliance on harvested rainwater in the context of reduced rainfall. This has been achieved by protecting groundwater wells from more frequent climate change induced storm surges and contaminations, and by enhancing women and youth&rsquo;s leadership through best practices and community awareness programmes on efficient usage (demand management) of rainwater.</p><p>Overall, the most appropriate and effective adaptation measures and strategies are most likely to be those that will be beneficial even in the absence of climate and sea-level change. Such measures and strategies could be considered as &ldquo;no regrets&rdquo; adaptation options. Therefore, in the first instance, the capacity of the Marshall Islands to adapt to the effects of climate and sea-level change will largely be determined by its ability to address on-going environmental, social and economic problems. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Although extreme poverty and hunger are rare, hardship and vulnerability are on the rise in the Republic of Marshall Islands, with one in five Pacific islanders continuing to live in relative poverty. The proportion of the population in most countries living below the national poverty line has either increased (Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu) or remains unchanged. </p><p>Multidimensional poverty is high across many countries due to geographic remoteness and lack of access to basic services. Environmental, social and economic factors, including limited land access and productive resources, have increased human mobility, including internal migration. Urbanization and the creation of informal settlements have led to new forms of hardship and scant access to public services. The long-term average growth rate for the Republic of Marshall Islands is estimated to be between 0.7 and 1 per cent. The economic costs of disasters will continue to detract from growth, with average losses falling between 0.5 and 6.6 percent of gross domestic product annually.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "125.7", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "38.7", "title": "Internet users, total", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "2.6", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita ", "unit": "tons"}, {"value": "12.4", "title": "Expected years of schooling ", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "74.1", "title": "Life expectancy at birth ", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "27.6", "title": "Mobile phone subscriptions ", "unit": "#"}, {"value": "1.225", "title": "Islands in RMI", "unit": "#"}, {"value": "870", "title": "Reef systems in RMI", "unit": "#"}]}
