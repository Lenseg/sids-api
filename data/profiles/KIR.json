The atolls have a maximum height of 3 to 4 m above mean sea level and support an estimated population of about 95,000 people. Kiribati&rsquo;s capital Tarawa is one of the most densely populated areas in the world, home to around half of Kiribati&rsquo;s total population. </p><p>Because of a limited base of natural resources, most of the population lives in subsistence conditions with the main industries being tourism and export of Copra and fish. The atoll nation of Kiribati is one of the most remote and geographically dispersed in the world, spread over 3.5 million km2 of ocean &ndash; an area larger than the entire Caribbean. In contrast to their small populations and land areas, the Pacific countries are often referred to as &lsquo;big ocean states&rsquo;. </p><p>In Kiribati, coastal erosion, sea water from storm surges inundating the land, extensive sea spray, and coral bleaching are being observed - quite consistent with what to expect from climate change. These changes are adversely affecting the people&rsquo;s livelihood. Climate change through its impacts of sea level rise leading to coastal erosion, and more frequent and damaging storm surges bounding on the edges of the land will reduce agricultural productivity such as of pandanus varieties, and coconut.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Between 2000 and 2019, Kiribati&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.553 to 0.630, an increase of 13.9 percent.

Kiribati&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 78.7 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>The 2016-19 Kiribati Development Plan (2016-2019) laid out the vision Kiribati has been following including &nbsp;priority areas on managing population growth, strengthening governance, &nbsp;improvement of infrastructure, stabilizing and growing the economy as well as access to basic services, improved health standards, climate change adaptation, and gender equity and the empowerment of women.</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The combination of its geographic location and economic situation makes Kiribati one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Beyond the pressing challenges of sea-level rise, over 75 per cent of all reported disasters in the Pacific are climate related. Frequent cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis have reversed gains in development progress in the subregion, with many Pacific islanders living in a constant state of recovery. Although women, youth and vulnerable groups are more severely affected by disasters, gender-sensitive and socially inclusive investments in risk reduction and recovery have been limited. Since most inhabitants reside on the coast, they are highly susceptible to sea-level rise, which threatens the very existence of atoll nations such as Kiribati.</p><p>High population growth and increasing urbanisation have placed additional pressures on water, sanitation and housing. Kiribati has the lowest access to clean water and sanitation in the Pacific. Kiribati&rsquo;s small economy is highly exposed to external shocks and debt stress; with a strong reliance on development assistance, fishing licence revenues and overseas remittances. </p><p>Although extreme poverty and hunger are rare, hardship and vulnerability are on the rise in the subregion, with one in five Pacific islanders continuing to live in relative poverty. The proportion of the population in most countries living below the national poverty line has either increased (Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu) or remains unchanged. Multidimensional poverty is high across many countries due to geographic remoteness and lack of access to basic services. Environmental, social and economic factors, including limited land access and productive resources, have increased human mobility, including internal migration. Urbanization and the creation of informal settlements have led to new forms of hardship and scant access to public services.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "134", "title": "Human Development Index\n", "unit": ""}, {"value": "68.4", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "19.8\n", "title": "Population in multidimensional poverty, headcount", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "98.4\n", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "100", "title": "The proportion of the population using basic drinking water services", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "3.5", "title": "In severe multidimensional poverty", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "24.7", "title": "Inequality in life expectancy at birth", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "14.6", "title": "Internet users", "unit": "%"}]}
