As the majority of the country&rsquo;s means of production are owned and run by the government, a large percent of the population of Cuba is employed by the state.</p><p>Efforts are being made to address issues such as demographic dynamics, population aging, and care services. The development model is being updated and, after a broad process of consultation, the new Constitution was approved in 2019 to legitimize citizens&rsquo; rights, promote recognition of and respect for family diversity, and improve ways of coping with gender violence situations. The environmental sustainability approach will be incorporated and the right to a healthy environment protected.

Its high human development index score of 0.777 (placing it 73rd on a global scale) is the result of achievements in education, health and life expectancy. Among the indicators showing better performance than expected given its level of income are: women&rsquo;s representation in parliament, life expectancy, child malnutrition, average schooling, and pupil-teacher ratio in primary education.</p><p>Furthermore, very positive social indicators are maintained, including an infant mortality rate of 4.0 per 1,000 live births and a mortality rate in children under five of 5.4 per 1,000. The average educational level of the population over 25 years of age stands at 11.5 years, and school-life expectancy at 14 years.</p><p>The Cuban government continues to update its economic and social models. The preservation of social achievements and the full development of human beings are ratified as priorities. Key programmatic documents for national strategic planning conceptualize the development model, setting priorities and lines of action. The plan, adopted in 2017, identifies six major economic sectors including: tourism, biotechnological and pharmaceutical sector, food production; energy, particularly renewables; construction; and professional services. At the sectoral level, priorities focus on stimulating food production, housing, sustainable tourism, and computerization. All this goes hand in hand with protection and rational use of natural resources, conservation of ecosystems, environmental quality, and reduction of vulnerabilities to the impact of climate change and extreme hydro-meteorological events under the State plan to confront climate change.</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>However, there are difficulties in maintaining the levels achieved and promoting sustainable development. Despite current levels of equity, there are differences between and within territories and among population groups. In connection with the provincial human development index, there are differences between the provinces and the capital city, with the eastern region facing the most unfavorable situation. </p><p>A principal task is to achieve a prosperous and efficient economy, but the economic growth rate remains below the 5 percent level, with gross domestic product growth averaging 1.5 percent between 2016 and 2018. Despite the efforts made, technological gaps in the production system and mechanisms limit the development of efficient chains. Key economic sectors, such as agriculture, have not achieved sustained growth. Considering the high dependence on fossil fuel imports (2,843.2 millions in 2017) and low efficiency in the use of energy carriers, improved efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources by up to 24 percent in the energy matrix by 2030 remains a priority. The country spends over one billion dollars every year on food imports. </p><p>The high housing deficit, estimated at 929,000 dwellings, is aggravated by recurrent high-intensity hurricanes. Despite the country&rsquo;s preparedness in comprehensive disaster risk management, the losses caused by the last two hurricanes (Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017) amounted to over $15.6 billion, with most damage inflicted on the housing and agricultural sectors. There has been an increase in drought periods, coastal flooding due to rising sea levels, and extreme hydrometeorological events, causing damage to the population and the economy.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "78.8", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "14.3", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "27.1", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "4", "title": "Infant mortality rate", "unit": "per 1000"}, {"value": "1.5", "title": "Annual GDP growth", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "929000", "title": "Estimated deficit in housing", "unit": "houses"}, {"value": "20.1", "title": "Population over 60 years old", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "57", "title": "Share of internet users", "unit": "%"}]}
