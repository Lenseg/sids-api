Ninety percent of the population resides in the coastal strip where the main urban centres and commercial activities are to be found. There is a wide range of geographic types with coastal, hilly sandy, highland, forested and savannah regions. The country can be divided into climatic regions ranging from dry (annual rainfall less than 1788 mm) to extremely wet (annual rainfall greater than 4100 mm). Economic activities are concentrated in services (&gt;50 percent of real gross domestic product (GDP)), agriculture (22.8 percent) and mining (10.6 per cent).

Maternal health was the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) that lagged furthest behind in Guyana, even though maternal mortality rates were reduced from 280 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010 to 250 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014.
