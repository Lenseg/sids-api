The State of Grenada has a population of 112,523 people and is a sovereign state. The country&rsquo;s 345 square kilometer land base is characterized by mountainous terrain. There are a variety of coastal and marine resources in Grenada - coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangrove swamps, which have proven to be of crucial importance in the formation and sustenance of other resources as well as near-shore fisheries. Economic activity in the country is dominated primarily by services (tourism and education) and agricultural production (nutmeg and cocoa).</p><p>The largest age groups in Grenada are young adults (20-34, 26.2%). Grenada has a high rate of unemployment, at nearly 25 percent. Grenada has been adversely affected by extreme weather events over the past several decades; two hurricanes in 2004 caused damage totaling approximately 2.5 times the country&rsquo;s annual Gross Domestic Product, and damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the island&rsquo;s buildings. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Grenada&rsquo;s Human Development Index (HDI) value for 2017 is 0.772, which puts the country in the high human development category&mdash;positioning it at 75 out of 189 countries and territories.

The country is leveraging technology, innovation and human capital, to define plans to be a Smart Small State that will leapfrog the nation toward a more sustainable, inclusive and prosperous future. </p><p>Whilst committed to achieving the 2030 agenda, Grenada in on a specific mission to end the scourge of Family Violence. Research indicates that one in every three women in Grenada has, or will, experience Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in their lifetime. Therefore, with the support of UN joint programmes, Grenada has implemented several initiatives to address this issue to end all forms of Violence Against Women And Girls (VAWG). .</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>As a small island, Grenada is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Extreme events experienced in the recent past are likely to become more intense and/or frequent in the future. One of the backbones of Grenada&rsquo;s economy, tourism is expected to suffer severe disruptions as a consequence of sea level rise, from the adverse effects of beach erosion, coastal land loss, inundation and flooding. </p><p>While Grenada has been active in formulating policies and strategies relating to adaptation and climate resilience over the years, there remain substantial gaps and challenges. On the national level, an integrated and strategic approach to adaptation plus performance monitoring systems and the prioritisation of activities is still lacking. Furthermore, the coordination between stakeholders as well as a joint knowledge management on adaptation is weak. At present, capacity is not sufficient to prepare large projects that will enable Grenada to access climate change finance internationally, nor has a National Implementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund be established. This has hampered the Government&acute;s ability to effectively acquire resources for urgent adaptation needs. </p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "16.9", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": "110", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "50", "title": "Forest Area", "unit": "% of total land area"}, {"value": "89.3", "title": "Ratio of female-to-male labor force participation rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "0.1", "title": "Mean area that is protected in marine sites important to biodiversity", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "60", "title": "Ocean Health Index: Clean Waters score (worst 0\u2013100 best)", "unit": "-"}, {"value": "34.5", "title": "Mean area that is protected in terrestrial sites important to biodiversity", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "14", "title": "The proportion of total government spending on essential education", "unit": "%"}]}
