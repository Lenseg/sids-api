The island is surrounded by a fringing coral reef between 120 and 300 meters wide. The reef drops away sharply on the seaward edge, at an angle of about 40 degrees, to a depth of about 4000 meters. The land area consists of a narrow coastal plain, ranging from 100 to 300 meters wide, which encircles a limestone escarpment rising some 30 meters to a central plateau, known locally as &quot;Topside&quot;. </p><p>Located on the Ring of Fire, the subregion where Nauru is located is among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change, extreme weather and disasters. Frequent cyclones, earthquakes and tsunamis have reversed gains in development progress in the subregion, with many Pacific islanders living in a constant state of recovery. Official development assistance, overseas remittances and imported goods are necessary to support local resources and capacity.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Efforts are currently being made to contribute to poverty reduction, sustainable livelihoods and climate resilience through integration of the management of land, water, forest, biodiversity and coastal resources. </p><p>Nauru has increased its efforts in agriculture and fish production including the increasing revenue from fisheries access fees and development of the informal sector. However, limited power and water supply continue to be critical concerns for businesses. </p><p>Support for women&rsquo;s political participation led to an increase in the number of women in parliament, and civil society started to engage more effectively with governance institutions. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Nauru faces vulnerabilities to geographic isolation, ecological fragility, limited resources and a narrow economic base, and external shocks. These wide-ranging economic, social, environmental and political challenges threaten Nauru&rsquo;s development and growth pathways, including achievement of the sustainable development goals and the SAMOA Pathway.</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s Nauru had one of the highest per capita incomes in the world due to a booming phosphate extraction industry, however, these stores were thought to be nearly depleted and the end of phosphate mining left a legacy of environmental degradation and unemployment. This led to severe financial crises and political instability. Nauru imports staple foods and water, and land degradation from strip mining has destroyed around 80% of the island, severely limiting the potential for agriculture. Naura has the highest incidence of food poverty, with one in four people living below the basic needs poverty line. Infant, child, and adult mortality rates remain high and Nauru has the shortest life expectancy of any country in the Pacific. </p><p>While other countries in the subregion have made progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of women through legal and policy reform, gender discrimination, exclusion and gender-based violence remain a serious concern also in Nauru, Women comprise 7.5 per cent of national legislators.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "11.2", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "99.2", "title": "Exports and imports", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "57.0", "title": "Internet users", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "4.7", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita ", "unit": ""}, {"value": "96.5", "title": "Skilled labour force", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "94.6\n", "title": "Mobile phone subscriptions ", "unit": ""}, {"value": "24.0", "title": "Child malnutrition, stunting (moderate or severe)", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "54", "title": "Tuberculosis incidence ", "unit": "%"}]}
