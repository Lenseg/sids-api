The country&rsquo;s population is approximately 110,940, with adult literacy at 88.1 percent and per capita Gross Domestic Product approximately US$18,100. The country&rsquo;s economy is highly dependent on tourism and agricultural production; approximately 60 percent of the workforce is employed by banana production, and the industry accounts for 50 percent of the island nation&rsquo;s exports. Offshore fisheries are also important and are predominantly small scale and artisanal.&nbsp; The population density is currently 285 per km&sup2;. The country is home to about 31,300 acres (12666.7 ha.) of tropical forests.

Saint VCT&rsquo;s&nbsp;GNI per capita increased by about 96.2 percent between 1990 and 2019.&nbsp;In 2001, the economy experienced real growth of 1.8 percent and continued to demonstrate positive real growth due to a positive spill-off from the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector as well as activities in the hotel and restaurant and construction sectors.</p><p>VCT&nbsp;has shown its commitment to mitigating climate change by independently taking concrete measures to reduce its emissions, particularly through renewable energy and waste initiatives. The largest contributor to reducing emissions will be the installation of a geothermal electricity generation facility, which when operational will provide over 50% of the country&rsquo;s electricity needs. VCT intends to develop its GHG sinks through reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation and reduced forest degradation.&nbsp;</p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>The country is still grappling with the impacts of volcanic eruptions in April 2021. The geography, geology, and socio-economic circumstances of VCT make it extremely vulnerable to climate-related natural disasters. Due to its mountainous topography, most activities on the mainland are concentrated on the narrow, low-lying coastline, at risk to sea-level rise and coastal erosion while the landscape also adds risks of landslides and flash flooding. An increase in severe weather events will result in significant expenditures, which will further constrain VCT&rsquo;s social and economic growth.&nbsp;Furthermore, the government lacks financial and technical resources to address these challenges.&nbsp;There is currently no monitoring of sea level around VCT. With climate-related events already causing damage and loss, these projections have dire implications for agriculture, water availability, and the protection of public and tourism infrastructure if no meaningful action is taken.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "14.1", "title": "Expected years of schooling", "unit": "Years"}, {"value": "12,378", "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita ", "unit": "PPP$"}, {"value": "85.2", "title": "Exports and imports ", "unit": "% of GDP"}, {"value": "2", "title": "Carbon dioxide emissions, production emissions per capita ", "unit": "Tonnes"}, {"value": "69.2", "title": "Forest area", "unit": "(% of total land area"}, {"value": "97.2", "title": "Net primary enrollment rate ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "2", "title": "Renewable energy", "unit": "(% of Total Final Energy Consumption"}, {"value": "2.6", "title": "Energy efficiency", "unit": "MJ per US$ PPP"}]}
