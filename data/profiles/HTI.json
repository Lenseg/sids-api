About 70% of the island is mountainous. Haiti has a tropical climate, and the vegetation cover is mainly scrub, conifers and leafy mangroves. The population of Haiti is currently estimated to be 8 million, with an annual growth rate of about 2.1%. About 45% of the population is aged 15 years and below. Approximately 80% of Haiti&rsquo;s population is living in poverty. The widespread poverty and ecological degradation make Haiti particularly susceptible to climate change impacts. </p><p>Agriculture provides livelihood for nearly 70% of Haitians, through small-scale subsistence farming. Rapid deforestation, at a rate of about 1,000 hectares per year between 2005 and 2010, has left only three percent of the country with forest cover. Consequently, 25 of 30 watersheds in Haiti are completely deforested. This rate of deforestation results from the use of fuelwood to supply 71 percent of Haiti&rsquo;s energy requirements. Vulnerability to climate change was further increased in January 2010, when a crippling magnitude 7.0 earthquake destroyed much of Haiti&rsquo;s capital city. </p><p>Every two to three years, Haiti faces cyclones, storms or tropical depressions. These events constitute the most fatal natural disasters and are responsible for floods, landslides, tidal waves, epidemics, loss of cattle and cultures and destruction of infrastructures and habitats.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Between 1990 and 2019, Haiti&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.414 to 0.510, an increase of 23.2 percent.

The first national housing and habitat policy was adopted in 2013. Support for administrative reform led to more transparent and equitable management of public service for women. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Great progress needs to be made, especially in rural areas where 80 percent of Haitians live in extreme poverty. Significant regional imbalance in terms of development contributes to accelerated rural exodus. The population is now 48 percent urban, with rapidly expanding slums that increase socio-economic inequalities and marginalization. </p><p>Significant challenges remain related to the regulatory framework, the heavy bureaucratic processes, and widespread corruption within the legislative branch. This has caused the frequent denial of justice, particularly women and minors. Although the restructuring of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is on the agenda for 2017, problems of legal certainty, citizen security, and access to justice remain serious. </p><p>The vulnerability of Haiti to natural hazards is exacerbated by environmental degradation, characterized in rural areas by deforestation, the drying up of rivers, soil erosion and watershed degradation.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": "8051", "title": "GDP per capita (2021)", "unit": "million current US$"}, {"value": "-0.9", "title": "GDP growth rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": "0.51", "title": "Human Development Index (HDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": "0.875", "title": "Gender Development Index (GDI) (2019)", "unit": ""}, {"value": "0.2", "title": "Multi-dimensional Poverty Index (MPI)", "unit": ""}, {"value": "63.55", "title": "Life expectancy at birth", "unit": "years"}, {"value": "54.3", "title": "Infant Mortality Rate  ", "unit": "per 1000 births"}, {"value": "1.3", "title": "Population Growth Rate", "unit": "%"}]}
