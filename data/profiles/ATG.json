Climatic features include relatively high and uniform temperatures throughout the year and steady easterly trade winds. Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the frequency of hurricane activity and impacts. The marine and coastal ecosystems sustain Antigua &amp; Barbuda&rsquo;s sandy beaches and fisheries resources and protect against tropical storms and hurricane activity. Antigua and Barbuda&rsquo;s marine and coastal environments are characterized by mangroves, coral reefs and sea-grass beds. </p><p>Tourism is a significant sector in the country, comprising more than half of the annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), with other major industries including construction, agriculture, transport, communications, and banking and financial services. In addition, cruise tourism is a solid sub-sector, assuming an increasing tourism market share. The agriculture sector is also an essential part of the country&rsquo;s economy, with major crops including fish, cotton, livestock, vegetables and pineapples. </p><p>The Government of Antigua and Barbuda places a high priority on education and usually allocates the largest share of the Government&rsquo;s budget to education, recognizing that education is key to the advancement of its people and human capital development and the overall development competitiveness of the island nation.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Antigua and Barbuda&rsquo;s HDI value for 2019 is 0.778, putting the country in the high human development category.

In 2021, the Government established the Department of the Blue Economy and approved the country&rsquo;s first Maritime Blue Economy Plan (MBEP).
