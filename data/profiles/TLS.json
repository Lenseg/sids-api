Peaceful, democratic elections were held in 2012, 2017 and 2018. Due to greater dependency on oil revenue, which accounted for 81 percent of all domestic revenues in 2016, the gross domestic product per capita is $3,670. Nevertheless, income is not evenly distributed, as nearly 50 percent of the population lives in poverty. The oil reserves are finite and may be depleted by the early 2020s. New sources of oil appear far from coming on-line.</p><p>In 2015, the population of Timor-Leste was 1.2 million, with a total fertility rate at 4.7 indicating a decline from 6.4 in 2010. Modern family planning methods contributed to this decline, although contraceptive prevalence has not significantly increased since 2010. The country is beginning to experience a youth bulge, with 32% of its population aged 10-24 years. Population growth is expected to exert increasing pressure on the economy, resources and social services, as highlighted in the Common Country Assessment. Given the high fertility scenario, there could be an additional 20,000 children (aged 6-17 years) and 300,000 people of working age by 2030. </p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Between 2000 and 2019, Timor-Leste&rsquo;s HDI value increased from 0.484 to 0.606, increasing 25.2 percent.

As a result, Timor-Leste&rsquo;s GNI per capita increased by about 74.0 percent between 1990 and 2019.</p><p>Despite the fierce destruction that leveled the country to the ground in the wake of the 1999 referendum, and later, its rebirth in 2002 as the first new sovereign state of the 21st century, Timor-Leste has marked successes in democracy and peacebuilding. Today, it is ranked the number 1 democratic country in South East Asia, leading elections in both 2017 and 2018 for the first time completely on its own, which international observer groups confirmed as transparent, credible and well-managed. The judiciary has also made important gains in upholding the rule of law; the national parliament enacts the legal framework and provides the required oversight; and the Provedor in protecting human rights. </p>"}, "challengesInDevelopment": {"title": "Challenges in Development", "content": "<p>Despite impressive democratic achievements, Timor-Leste still faces unresolved challenges in the judiciary and access to justice, effective local governance, impactful gender equality, media freedom and human rights.

In addition, a significant gender gap remains on its Economic Participation and Opportunity subindex.</p><p>While access to services has improved, persistent inequalities in access to high-quality services and opportunities remain a key challenge to development and human rights.
