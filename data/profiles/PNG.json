The capital, Port Moresby, has a population of approximately 400,000. &nbsp;Other main regional centres are Goroka, Mt. Hagen in the densely populated Highlands Region, the commercial port of Lae on the north coast and Kokopo/Rabaul in the New Guinea Islands.</p>"

Despite increasing national wealth, human development outcomes continue to lag behind: PNG currently ranks 156 out of 187 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI). &nbsp;Life expectancy is 63 years, 25 per cent of children are unable to attend school, and adult literacy is around 50%. </p><p>Only seven per cent of the population has access to the electric grid and a reticulated water system, and two-fifths of health/sub-health centres and rural health posts have no electricity or essential medical equipment. While food security is normally not a serious problem, poverty and social inequality are persistent, with an estimated 40 per cent of the population living on less than US$1.25/day. Gender equality is a significant challenge and systemic violations of women&rsquo;s rights exist throughout the country. PNG ranks in the bottom ten countries of the Gender Inequality Index. The health system has struggled for decades to provide universal access to quality services. </p><p>Climate change and environmental degradation due to over-exploitation of natural resources, unsustainable land use, fishing practices, habitat destruction, pollution and poor environmental governance increases the vulnerability of PNG to natural hazards. </p>"

The PNG Constitution guarantees human rights (although challenges remain in implementing and protecting those rights in law, policy, and practice.)</p><p>The economic performance of PNG has steadily improved over the past decade due to a significant resources boom, mainly in the extractive minerals and hydro-carbon sector. &nbsp;Gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 5.5 per cent in 2009 to 7 per cent in 2010. &nbsp;The construction of a major liquefied natural gas pipeline (PNG-LNG) from the Southern Highlands will be the single largest investment in the country&rsquo;s history (140% of GDP). &nbsp;LNG exports, which will start late in 2014, will increase GDP by 150% and could triple the country&rsquo;s export revenue by 2020. With this boost in GDP, public finances will be under pressure to ensure increased revenues translate into sustained equitable gains for all Papua New Guineans.</p><p>The Government of PNG is addressing service delivery through public sector reforms and capacity building of the civil service. &nbsp;The National Education Plan (2005-2014) envisages the incremental introduction of free primary education to increase enrolments in basic education from 957,000 (2005) to 1.3 million by 2014. In early 2013, the Government introduced a free education policy up to Grade 9 to expand access to basic education as well as a free health care policy.</p>"
