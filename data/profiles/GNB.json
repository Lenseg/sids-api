According to the World Bank, GDP per capita has dropped from $802 in 2018 to $727 in 2020 (both in current USD and showing a 9.3% drop in 2 years). This drop is, on the one hand, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, due to the unfavorable economic environment and political instability.</p><p>Agriculture is the country&#39;s most dominant economic sector, accounting for an average of 84% of export earnings between 2016 and 2018, alongside fisheries. Both sectors employ more than 80% of the working population. While Cashew nuts are the country&#39;s biggest exports, other products, such as gold and timber, make up part of the portfolio. Historically, the primary sectors (agriculture, forests, and fisheries) came to represent an average of 44% of GDP between 2001 and 2017. More recently, the services sector has grown and today represents around 45% of GDP, followed mainly by the agri-food industry (15%).</p><p>Demographically, Youth (15-35 years old) make up &nbsp;50% &nbsp;of &nbsp;the population, &nbsp;representing &nbsp;an &nbsp;opportunity &nbsp;for &nbsp;social &nbsp;and &nbsp;economic &nbsp;development, &nbsp;as young &nbsp;women and &nbsp;men &nbsp;can &nbsp;contribute &nbsp;as &nbsp;agents &nbsp;of &nbsp;change, &nbsp;political &nbsp;actors, innovators, &nbsp;entrepreneurs, &nbsp;and peacebuilders. &nbsp;</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>Between 1990 and 2019, Guinea-Bissau&rsquo;s life expectancy at birth increased by 11.2 years, mean years of schooling increased by 1.3 years and expected years of schooling increased by 7.0 years.

In the longer term, the IMF forecasts an average annual growth of 5%, thanks to public investment spending in major road and energy infrastructure.</p><p>In 2017,Guinea-Bissau&rsquo;s cashew nut production placed it as the 7th largest exporter in the world.
