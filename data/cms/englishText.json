They hold 19.1 percent of the world\u2019s exclusive economic zones, which are sea zones over which States have special rights for use. Their combined ocean area is 20.7 times that of their land territory. This huge difference between the size of sovereign territory in the ocean and on land underscores the potential for SIDS to realize greater socioeconomic benefits from their sustainable blue economies. The blue economy is defined as the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, jobs, and social and financial inclusion, with a focus on the preservation as well as the restoration of the health of ocean ecosystems.Sustainable blue economy opportunities in SIDS cover a broad spectrum, including existing dominant sectors in fishing and coastal tourism as well as actual or potential new contributors such as aquaculture, ocean-based energy (waves, tides and wind), offshore oil and gas, sustainable maritime transport, desalination, research and education, and marine genetic resources. The blue economy can also include non-market economic benefits such as carbon storage, coastal protection, cultural values and biodiversity. Unlocking the full potential of their blue economies can assist SIDS in achieving not only SDG 14, on oceans, but could have ripple effects on other goals, including SDGs 1 (poverty), 5 (gender equality) and 8 (growth and decent work).UNDP\u2019s vision is to support SIDS to pursue transformative blue economies and achieve prosperity through an integrated approach rooted in sustainable finance and development.

Small in size, they can offer ideal conditions as innovation incubators, pioneering new technologies that can be tested, replicated and scaled up elsewhere. SIDS can become frontrunners in the use of digital technologies to accelerate sustainable development and mitigate many of the challenges that they face. These can be tested and then scaled up elsewhere.SIDS are working to address challenges in core infrastructure and connectivity needed to make this leap. Significant progress on increasing connectivity has put SIDS on track to achieve targets for the universality and affordability of Internet access. According to current trends, mobile broadband coverage will reach almost 90 per cent of the population As of September 2019, mobile broadband coverage covered 85 percent of the population, and over half the SIDS had an Internet penetration rate of over 60 percent.1Many SIDS continue to struggle when it comes to improving two key issues: digital capacities and inclusive access to digital technologies. This widening digital gap is seen, for instance, in the limited availability of online content in local languages, and inadequate broadband infrastructure and capacity, particularly in rural areas. Without proactive measures, new technologies are going to exacerbate already existing inequalities within communities. As the 2019 Human Development Report highlighted, those with less access to new technologies are at high risk of being left behind. The exclusion of women and some social groups in digitalization is not only a matter of human rights but may infer significant costs for SIDS as it results in losing resources for innovation and economic development. These challenges need to be systematically addressed. UNDP recognizes the need to explore the potential for digital transformation in SIDS alongside the urgency of bridging the persistent digital divide.UNDP\u2019s vision is to support SIDS in taking advantage of the opportunities of a digital age, while managing the associated challenges and overcoming existing constraints in access and capacity.</p>"}, "profileTooltip-climate": {"title": "Climate Action", "content": "<p><b>Promoting decarbonized and resilient societies through scaled up climate action and enhanced efforts to mobilize climate finance.</b>SIDS are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, but they are also at the forefront of climate solutions.

It highlights their collective determination to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and includes cross-cutting initiatives and partnerships that are SIDS-focused and SIDS-defined. The Package introduced bold commitments by SIDS to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and develop comprehensive plans and strategies for low greenhouse gas emissions in island contexts, energy transformation and improved adaptive capacity. As SIDS take action to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 crisis, ambitious and prompt climate action remains at the top of their agendas. With disruptions in global value chains having uncovered the precarity of energy supplies in SIDS, transforming energy systems by building resilience and self-sufficiency is core to the first pillar of UNDP\u2019s offer.UNDP\u2019s vision is to help SIDS towards these goals by promoting decarbonized and resilient societies, and scaled-up climate action.

This country profile data is all available for export, and we are currently working on adding features to export detailed country reports. </p>"}, "aboutThis-gis": {"title": "About this", "content": "<p>Next, one of the most promising advancements in the field of data science is geospatial data, due to its precision, broad spatial coverage, high sub-country resolution to identify regions of risk or opportunity within each country, and diversity of publicly available datasets, either modeled or measured, that are of high relevance for the SIDS. For geospatial modeling, SIDS often face challenges because of their diverse geographies concentrated in near proximity, with a scarcity baseline information necessary for training or validating models and research studies. Thus, SIDS are often left out of global modeling efforts, and this makes data difficult to integrate into policy-making . </p><p> There are three primary objectives for this geospatial platform to bring value to the SIDS. </p> <p> First, it acts to centralize geospatial data in SIDS, in order to advance precision and accessibility of research and innovation in SIDS. We have compiled and standardized a large GIS database currently including layers from more than 80 unique data sources relevant to development in SIDS. </p> <p>Second, it presents analysis tools to explore correlation between datasets, geographic vulnerability, and development potential. We have designed an analytics toolkit for conducting development studies within the SIDS that allow for users to test hypotheses, export analyses and compare regional development potential and risks. A geospatial platform can help to answer real world questions that SIDS have regarding future policy and climate action: Where should infrastructure or social service funds be allocated based on GDP? Which areas on an island are best suited for sustainable development - wind energy potential? solar energy potential? What will the impacts be on biodiversity and ecosystems? Finding relationships between datasets is vital, especially when land is a finite resource, and visualizing these relationships will help provide crucial insight. </p> <p>Third, it features specific UNDP geospatial studies, including digital assessments and other georeferenced datasets. These data can be used in tandem with our compiled database to allow correlations to be drawn through overlays and analytic methods, designed specifically for non-technical development practitioners. For example, one data source within the UNDP we are looking to integrate are the digital assessments conducted by the Crisis Bureau which have good coverage of SIDS with both qualitative and quantitative results - the Household Building Damage Assessment (HBDA) and the Socioeconomic Impact Assessment (SEIA). We are currently prototyping specific interfaces to analyze and interact with SIDS results from these assessments, so they can be integrated into the platform and country governments with access to this data can conduct additional analytics by leveraging the SIDS spatial database. </p><p> The standardized database of geospatial datasets is one of the greatest values of this platform. This has been undertaken after a wide-ranging survey of all available geospatial datasets that are legally licensed for rerelease, including data from NASA SEDAC, USGS, IHME, journal articles in Nature, the Copernicus Climate Data Store, and many other sources. We then developed a data pipeline to standardize and resample them at several resolutions so they can be used for analytics. </p><p> In the GIS field there is a great challenge in utilizing geospatial data because of the wide variety of formats and data types. For example, every dataset can vary in projection, resolution, file format, spatial alignment, and in other key ways that raise significant barriers to data scientists to extract meaningful insights. By standardizing and centralizing this data we have significantly lowered the barrier of entry to anyone looking to do geospatial studies in the SIDS. </p><p> One of the primary challenges we have solved is in the storage and serving of these datasets to frontend users on the platform. There are three primary components to this spatial infrastructure: storage (built on Azure web services), interaction (the frontend experience where users interact with the data visualization and analysis tools), and computation (the middle step which links the data store with the frontend). This system is also dual function to both provide a frontend web experience, as well as providing a server for users to access and download these datasets in several formats and resolutions. </p><p> A user can select from our database of features including socioeconomic data such as population density, access to markets, and GDP, as well as development potential indices such as the potential for wind or solar power. By selecting an SDG or SAMOA Pathway Priority, a user can filter datasets to just one area of interest. These data can be viewed at multiple resolutions, as well as in 2D or 3D features, with additional overlays of vector datasets like administrative boundaries. Additional visualization and analysis tools allow users to build their own maps and export these visuals for communication and reporting. Beyond visualization, we are building a suite of analytics tools that make use of our rich database of geospatial information. There are multiple modes to compare datasets, through either a bivariate or dual mode that allows a user to analyze correlation between two datasets. A dynamic histogram for all datasets shows the distribution of values. Users can also select any single point to see all the datasets for that specific point and do additional analytics such as isochrone or Voronoi mapping, or to get regional statistics. We are currently adding additional analytic tools to this interface to make it more functional for development analyses. </p>"}, "aboutThis-mvi": {"title": "About this", "content": "<p> The data from this paper is presented in a parametric interface with a customizable version of the MVI, as well as multiple forms of visualizations that allow for an analysis of the contributions of each indicator towards SIDS vulnerability.
