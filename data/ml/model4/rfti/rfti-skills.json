These may be advanced but are generally lower than those required to originate the technologies. Two types of skills need to be considered: skills acquired through education, and skills acquired in the workplace through practical training or learning-by-doing. The overall educational attainment of the population is measured through expected years of schooling, while the skill level in the labour market is measured by the extent of high-skill employment \u2013 defined by the ILO as the sum of managers, professionals and technicians and associate professionals following the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). These indicators need to be interpreted with caution, especially in developing countries, because of the emigration of highly trained or skilled people, the \u201cbrain drain\u201d, as a result of which the actual skill level could be lower than the official estimate.", "name": "Skills ranking", "source": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "dataset": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "category": "Readiness for Frontier Technologies Index", "subcategory": "None", "link": "https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tir2020_en.pdf", "dim": "None", "priority": "4.0", "units": "Index"}, "confidenceIntervals": {"2021": {"BRB": 4.6, "BHS": 18.25, "VCT": 8.2}, "recentValue": {"BLZ": 505.25, "CPV": 505.25, "GUY": 288.7142857142857, "VCT": 505.25, "LCA": 202.1, "TLS": 2021.0, "TTO": 2021.0}}, "featureImportances": {"indicators": {"oecd-PAS_ALL_MAR_SQKM": 0.318, "unicef-a10": 0.455, "unicef-ncwh12": 0.279, "unicef-ah11": 0.011, "wdi2-SE.PRE.ENRR.MA": 0.868, "unicef-wee19": 0.496, "paris-162": 0.535, "wdi-IC.PRP.DURS": 0.2, "wdi2-per_sa_allsa.cov_q3_tot": 0.256, "ihme-tracheal,-bronchus,-and-lung-cancer": 0.125}, "categories": {"HIV/AIDS": 0.074, "Characteristic": 0.163, "Tuberculosis": 0.474, "Self-harm and interpersonal violence": 0.755}}}
