It considers three sectors that are early adopters: manufacturing, with high-tech manufacturing as the frontrunner; finance; and ICT, which tends to interact with other technologies. Then it uses export data, on high-technology manufactures, as well as on digitally deliverable services which cover both finance and ICT. However, especially in developing countries, activities are also undertaken by firms in the informal sector \u2013 which are often outside official statistics. The scores from these countries could therefore be lower than the actual activity.", "name": "Industry ranking", "source": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "dataset": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "category": "Readiness for Frontier Technologies Index", "subcategory": "None", "link": "https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tir2020_en.pdf", "dim": "None", "priority": "4.0", "units": "Index"}, "confidenceIntervals": {"2021": {"MUS": 74.0, "BHS": 31.5, "MDV": 38.25, "VCT": 14.6}, "recentValue": {"MDV": 505.25}}, "featureImportances": {"indicators": {"wdi-EG.USE.COMM.GD.PP.KD": 0.917, "wdi-LP.LPI.TIME.XQ": 0.262, "unicef-wash11": 0.099, "wdi2-SP.POP.1519.FE.5Y": 0.942, "egov-tii": 0.234, "wdi2-SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.MA.NE.ZS": 0.27, "oecd-COASTAL_100_POP_PC": 0.971, "paris-29": 0.969, "igrac-twap_sids_socioeconomic_percagridepgw": 0.953, "wdi-BM.TRF.PWKR.CD.DT": 0.457}, "categories": {"Other neoplasms": 0.116, "Resources": 0.22, "Unintentional injuries": 0.407, "Climate": 0.068}}}
