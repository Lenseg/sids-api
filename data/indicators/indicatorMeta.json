While we are hopeful that this indicator proves useful for shaping policy and inspiring greater attention in this issue category, we recognize that its novel nature also holds some degree of uncertainty in the underlying data and in the assumptions and decisions we made in its construction (see Chapter 7 for further discussion). We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase. The balance of indicators come from IHME and are measured in Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates (see Chapters 4\u20136). Aggregated to a global level, we find that the majority of DALYs lost are due to air pollution and, within that suite of risks, to ambient particulate matter (PM2. 5), which receive the greatest weights among the issue categories and indicators, respectively. All non-waste weights roughly correspond to the proportion of DALYs lost worldwide in the most recent year of available data (Blanc et al., 2008). Environmental Health is thus a combination of our regard for the data quality of a new indicator and an empirical analysis of the other metrics.", "Units": "Index", "Category": "Results", "Subcategory": "Final Results", "Dimension": "None", "Dataset": "epi", "Source": "Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy", "Link": "https://epi.yale.edu/", "Priority": "2.0", "Note": "", "# Years": 26.0, "# Countries": 39.0}, "epi-HMT": {"Indicator Code": "epi-HMT", "Indicator": "Heavy Metals", "Definition": "Though heavy metal pollution remains a global problem, lead pollution continues to slowly decline, which has shown that policy changes can make a marked difference.

However, lack of enforcement and the heightened prevalence of lead battery production and recycling contribute to high levels of lead exposure in low- and middle income countries.

Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended with 2004 data. DAC members are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovienia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and European Union Institutions.
