The projections of the yield productions are obtained from five crop models (EPIC, GEPIC, LPJmL, pDSSAT, PEGASUS), and it assumes effect of CO2 fertilization but does not adjust for changes in farming systems or irrigation. \nRationale: Rosenzweig, et al. (2013) compared results from seven crop models against agricultural impacts of climate change expressed by yield changes through the end of the century. ND-GAIN includes the average impacts on three crops (rice, wheat and maize) as an indication of the climate impacts on agriculture sector and food supply because these three crops make up two thirds of human food consumption (FAO). Calculation: The projected change is calculated by the percent change from the baseline projection of annual average of actual cereal yield in 1980-2009 to a future projection in 2040-2069 under the RCP4.5 emission scenario(about RCP emission scenarios see IPCC, 2014). Data for baseline and future are the average yield productions from the five crop models. The conversion from models to an Index follows a process whose explanation is beyond the goals of this report. Please contact the ND-GAIN team for obtaining such information.

The projected change of groundwater recharge due to climate change takes into account the climatic impacts on the factors of total runoff, precipitation intensity, relief, soil texture, aquifer properties, and the occurrence of glaciers and permafrost. ND-GAIN uses the projected change of annual groundwater recharge as a proxy to measure the climate impacts of freshwater resources, complementing the surface runoff water indicator. Calculation: The projected change is the percent decrease of the annual groundwater recharge from the baseline projection (1971-2000) to the future projection (2040- 2069) using RCP4.5 emission scenario. Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND- 17 GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value.

Data for all four are available from the annual ICT Development Index (IDI) database. The mobile phone subscription measures the subscription to public mobile services including the post-paid and prepaid subscriptions(World Development Indicators, 2014). The fixed phone subscription is assumed to measure of the active number of analog fixed telephone lines, ISDN channels, fixed wireless (WLL), public payphones and VoIP subscription (International Telecommunication Union, 2010). The fixed broad-band subscription refers to the number of broadband subscribers with a digital subscriber line, cable modem, or other high-speed technology (World Development Indicators, 2014). The individual internet use measures the proportion of internet users with access to the worldwide network (World Development Indicators, 2014). \nRationale: ICT infrastructure can facilitate many features of adaptation. For example, it enables knowledge integration and learning and key ingredients of adaptive capacity (Pant and Heeks 2011); it provides technical support for early warning systems; and it can strengthen local organizations that implement adaptation(Singh and Singh 2012). Calculation: The overall ICT infrastructure indicator takes the average over the scores of the four sub-indicators.

MPAs can help conserve and restore habitats and species and ensure that marine and coastal ecosystems continue to provide storm and erosion protection, carbon storage, fisheries, recreation and tourism opportunities, and other services. The importance of protected area networks for marine biodiversity and ecosystem services is recognised by the shared CDB Aichi Target 11 and SDG Target 14.5 to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The underlying data for this indicator are taken from UNEP-WCMC\u2019s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). For marine coverage the protected area boundaries are intersected with the boundaries of countries\u2019 Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) derived from the Flanders Marine Institute marine boundaries dataset. EEZs typically extend for 200 nautical miles from a country\u2019s coast or halfway to a neighbour where the zone would otherwise overlap.

To assess progress this report has developed a country readiness index. This takes into account technological capacities related to physical investment, human capital and\ntechnological effort, and covers national capacities to use, adopt and adapt these technologies:43\nUse \u2013 This requires basic capacities, passive skills and effort along with infrastructure, and some\ntechnological knowledge. This might involve, for example, following AI-driven recommendation\nfrom an e-commerce website, or using a chatbot.\nAdopt \u2013 Active use for one\u2019s own purposes requires more advanced capability levels. This\ncould mean using AI to produce recommendations or run a chatbot for a business website.\nAdapt \u2013 Modifying the technologies requires further advanced capabilities \u2013 such as for tailoring\nAI-driven recommendations or localizing the features of a chatbot.", "units": "Index", "category": "Digital", "subcategory": "None", "dim": "None", "dataset": "key", "source": "UNCTAD Technology and Innovation Report 2021", "link": "https://unctad.org/page/technology-and-innovation-report-2021", "priority": "4.0", "note": "", "numYears": 1.0, "numCountries": 16.0, "yearValueCounts": {"2021": "16"}}, "key-wdi2-SL.TLF.ACTI.ZS": {"indicatorCode": "key-wdi2-SL.TLF.ACTI.ZS", "indicator": "Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15-64)\u00a0", "def": "Labor force participation rate is the proportion of the population ages 15-64 that is economically active: all people who supply labor for the production of goods and services during a specified period.", "units": "% of total population ages 15-64", "category": "Blue", "subcategory": "None", "dim": "None", "dataset": "key", "source": "International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database.
