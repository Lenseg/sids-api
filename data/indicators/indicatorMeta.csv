epi-ECO,Ecosystem Vitality,"Whereas the policy objective of Environmental Health has a largely data-driven basis for deriving weights, the selection of weights in Ecosystem Vitality, shown in Figure 15-2, is more subjective. We attempt to strike a balance between the relative gravity of each issue category and the quality of the underlying data. According to the Planetary Boundaries model (Rockström et al., 2009), the two leading threats to the environment are biodiversity loss and climate change. Biodiversity loss is largely captured in our Biodiversity & Habitat issue category (25%), though the indicators in Ecosystem Services (10%) and Fisheries (10%) also reflect threats to this planetary boundary. Within Climate Change (40%), the emissions trends are roughly weighted according to their relative contributions to climate forcing – another empirically determined weighting. The balance of the weight within Ecosystem Vitality lies with Pollution Emissions (5%), Agriculture (5%), and Water Resources (5%). Although we are aware of the importance of these issue categories, the low weights given to them here are due mainly to the paucity of indicators, lack of recent measurements, and low data quality. As new data become available for measuring these issue categories, different weights may emerge in future versions of the EPI.",Index,Results,Final Results,None,epi,Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy,https://epi.yale.edu/,2.0,,0.0,48.0

As nations industrialize, governments tend to prioritize investments in sanitation infrastructure and strengthening of drinking water quality regulations, allowing for a moderate improvement in average global performance. However, expansion of clean water and sanitation services fails to keep pace with population growth in many countries. Life-years lost to death and disabilities from unsafe sanitation and unsafe drinking water remain particularly high in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.

epi-HLT,Environmental Health,"Weights within the Environmental Health policy objective reflect two approaches to assigning weights. The 2020 EPI introduces a new indicator, controlled solid waste, within a new issue category, Waste Management. While we are hopeful that this indicator proves useful for shaping policy and inspiring greater attention in this issue category, we recognize that its novel nature also holds some degree of uncertainty in the underlying data and in the assumptions and decisions we made in its construction (see Chapter 7 for further discussion). We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase. The balance of indicators come from IHME and are measured in Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates (see Chapters 4–6). Aggregated to a global level, we find that the majority of DALYs lost are due to air pollution and, within that suite of risks, to ambient particulate matter (PM2. 5), which receive the greatest weights among the issue categories and indicators, respectively. All non-waste weights roughly correspond to the proportion of DALYs lost worldwide in the most recent year of available data (Blanc et al., 2008). Environmental Health is thus a combination of our regard for the data quality of a new indicator and an empirical analysis of the other metrics.",Index,Results,Final Results,None,epi,Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy,https://epi.yale.edu/,2.0,,26.0,39.0
epi-HMT,Heavy Metals,"Though heavy metal pollution remains a global problem, lead pollution continues to slowly decline, which has shown that policy changes can make a marked difference. Regulations banning or limiting lead in petrol, paint, and plumbing have successfully reduced life-years lost to death or disability from lead exposure in many countries. Leaded gasoline, once the primary cause of global lead pollution, has been phased out in all but two countries, Iraq and Algeria (UNEP, 2019a). However, lack of enforcement and the heightened prevalence of lead battery production and recycling contribute to high levels of lead exposure in low- and middle income countries. Strong regulation and widespread adoption of safe industrial practices will be required to minimize the health impacts of this dangerous pollutant, as well as heavy metals in general.

Industrialized countries, particularly in Europe, exhibit the highest performance on controlled solid waste, while some lowand middle-income countries, including Colombia and Mauritius, have also adopted strong waste management systems suited to their development needs.

Rationale: Rosenzweig, et al. (2013) compared results from seven crop models against agricultural impacts of climate change expressed by yield changes through the end of the century. ND-GAIN includes the average impacts on three crops (rice, wheat and maize) as an indication of the climate impacts on agriculture sector and food supply because these three crops make up two thirds of human food consumption (FAO). Calculation: The projected change is calculated by the percent change from the baseline projection of annual average of actual cereal yield in 1980-2009 to a future projection in 2040-2069 under the RCP4.5 emission scenario(about RCP emission scenarios see IPCC, 2014).

Rationale: Surface water resources are considered susceptible to climate change because of the impact of temperature and precipitation variability on rainfall, snowpack, evaporation, etc. (EPA, n.d.). The projected change of annual runoff due to climate change takes into account impacts on precipitation, evaporation, transpiration and soil moisture, which are the key factors impacting volume of runoffs(Němec & 16 Schaake, 1982). ND-GAIN uses the projected change of annual runoff as a proxy to measure the climate impacts to surface water resources. Calculation: The projected change is the percent change in annual runoff from the baseline projection (1980-2009) to the future projection (2040-2069) using RCP4.5 emission scenario. Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND-GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value. The calculation here sets the 10 percentile to be the minimum value. Baseline and future projections are generated by averaging annual runoffs from six GCMs. ",%,Indicators,Water,raw,ndgain,"Projected change of water risks by Aqueduct, World Resource Institute",https://gain.nd.edu/,4.0,,,

Rationale: Ground water, together with surface water, is a key source of fresh water to supply drinking water and other water uses (EPA, n.d.). The projected change of groundwater recharge due to climate change takes into account the climatic impacts on the factors of total runoff, precipitation intensity, relief, soil texture, aquifer properties, and the occurrence of glaciers and permafrost. ND-GAIN uses the projected change of annual groundwater recharge as a proxy to measure the climate impacts of freshwater resources, complementing the surface runoff water indicator. Calculation: The projected change is the percent decrease of the annual groundwater recharge from the baseline projection (1971-2000) to the future projection (2040- 2069) using RCP4.5 emission scenario. Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND- 17 GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value.

This indicator uses the Warm Spell Duration Index (WSDI), which defines periods of excessive warmth using a percentile-based threshold calculated for a calendar 5-day window in the base period 1961-1990. WSDI counts the number of days in a year when daily maximum of near surface temperature exceeds the 90th percentile threshold for 6 consecutive days or longer (Alexander, et al., 2006; Sillmann, et al., 2013b). 
Rationale: Human living conditions are threatened by the increased intensity and/or frequency of extreme weather, including storms, flooding, landslides and heat waves, that climate change is bringing or will bring (Satterthwaite, 2008). Calculation: The projected change is the absolute change of WSDI from the baseline year (1960-1990) to the future projection (2040-2070), using RCP4.5 emission scenario.

Rationale: Countries in which urban populations are concentrated in a single or a small number of urban areas are considered more sensitive to climate change(Lankao, 2008). According to this indicator, a country with a highly concentrated urban sector and a highly urbanized population is the most sensitive. Calculation: Urban concentration is the product of Herfindahl measure of concentration of the urban population weighted by the percent of a country’s 28 population that is urbanized. The Herfindahl measure takes the sum of the squared percent of the population residing in each large city over the total population in these large cities.

ndgainid_infr_02-raw,Projected change of sea level rise impacts,"Description: An indication of how coastal infrastructure will be impacted by the combined effect of sea level rise and potential storm surge by the end of the century. The indicator considers the proportion of land areas, adjacent to the ocean, that are lower than the projected sea level rise and the average height of storm surge. 
Rationale: Sea level rise due to climate change is a threat to coastal infrastructure, requiring resilient infrastructure that protects coastal areas (Lemmen& Warren, 2004; Tol, et al., 2008; Hallegatte, 2009). ND-GAIN assumes that the potential risk or damage to coastal infrastructure from sea level rise depends on the extent of coastal areas exposed to both sea level rise and potential storm surge. Calculation: The global average of sea level rise by the end of the century under RCP45 scenario is projected to be 0.32-0.63 m (IPCC, 2013). There is no consistent average height of storm surge because the factors vary tremendously. 1.5m or 2-3 m is considered to be the moderate zone (Smith et al., 2010). Taking 0.63 m of the projected change of sea level rise and 3 m of moderate height of storm surge, ND-GAIN estimates the impact to be the proportion of ocean-adjacent land areas lower than 4 m above sea level.

ndgainid_soci_02-raw,Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure,"Description: A composite indicator from 4 sub-indicators that consider both the access to and the use of ICT infrastructure: mobile phone subscription per 100 persons, fixed phone subscription per 100 persons, fixed broad-band subscription per 100 persons, and percent of individuals using internet. Data for all four are available from the annual ICT Development Index (IDI) database. The mobile phone subscription measures the subscription to public mobile services including the post-paid and prepaid subscriptions(World Development Indicators, 2014). The fixed phone subscription is assumed to measure of the active number of analog fixed telephone lines, ISDN channels, fixed wireless (WLL), public payphones and VoIP subscription (International Telecommunication Union, 2010). The fixed broad-band subscription refers to the number of broadband subscribers with a digital subscriber line, cable modem, or other high-speed technology (World Development Indicators, 2014). The individual internet use measures the proportion of internet users with access to the worldwide network (World Development Indicators, 2014). 
Rationale: ICT infrastructure can facilitate many features of adaptation. For example, it enables knowledge integration and learning and key ingredients of adaptive capacity (Pant and Heeks 2011); it provides technical support for early warning systems; and it can strengthen local organizations that implement adaptation(Singh and Singh 2012).

A drought is an extended period of time characterized by a deficiency in a region's water supply that is the result of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture, affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream, lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property. A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate assistance during a period of emergency resulting from a natural disaster; it can also include displaced or evacuated people.

Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned.

Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and ""other"" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries.
