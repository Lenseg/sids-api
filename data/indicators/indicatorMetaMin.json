The 2020 EPI introduces a new indicator, controlled solid waste, within a new issue category, Waste Management.

We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase. The balance of indicators come from IHME and are measured in Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates (see Chapters 4\u20136). Aggregated to a global level, we find that the majority of DALYs lost are due to air pollution and, within that suite of risks, to ambient particulate matter (PM2. 5), which receive the greatest weights among the issue categories and indicators, respectively. All non-waste weights roughly correspond to the proportion of DALYs lost worldwide in the most recent year of available data (Blanc et al., 2008).

Calculation: The projected change is the percent change in annual runoff from the baseline projection (1980-2009) to the future projection (2040-2069) using RCP4.5 emission scenario. Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND-GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value.
