The projections of the yield productions are obtained from five crop models (EPIC, GEPIC, LPJmL, pDSSAT, PEGASUS), and it assumes effect of CO2 fertilization but does not adjust for changes in farming systems or irrigation. \nRationale: Rosenzweig, et al. (2013) compared results from seven crop models against agricultural impacts of climate change expressed by yield changes through the end of the century. ND-GAIN includes the average impacts on three crops (rice, wheat and maize) as an indication of the climate impacts on agriculture sector and food supply because these three crops make up two thirds of human food consumption (FAO). Calculation: The projected change is calculated by the percent change from the baseline projection of annual average of actual cereal yield in 1980-2009 to a future projection in 2040-2069 under the RCP4.5 emission scenario(about RCP emission scenarios see IPCC, 2014). Data for baseline and future are the average yield productions from the five crop models. The conversion from models to an Index follows a process whose explanation is beyond the goals of this report. Please contact the ND-GAIN team for obtaining such information.
