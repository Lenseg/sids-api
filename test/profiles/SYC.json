Goal 6 was not achieved due to increasing HIV prevalence among vulnerable population groups.  <br />3. Seychelles has historically viewed  its natural  environment as  the  pathway  to  sustainable <br />development.  Like  many  small island  States,  Seychelles  is  dependent on the  healthy  functioning of <br />both  its  terrestrial  and  marine  ecosystems  for  its  economic  development  and  social  well-being. <br />Seventy % of its gross  domestic product, and more than 90 % of  its exports, depend on <br />natural,  pristine,  diverse  and  productive  terrestrial  and  marine  ecosystem  services  for  tourism  and fisheries.  The  country  consists  of  a  landmass  of  455  km2  forming  155  islands,  and  an  exclusive economic zone covering 1.37 million km2 \u2013 the second largest in Africa (after South Africa). With a restricted land area, there are intense competing pressures on land resources for tourism, agriculture, housing, water, and other needs. Over 50 % of terrestrial and 10 % of marine areas are under protection5.  <br />4. Extreme  poverty  in  Seychelles,  based  on  the  World  Bank  indicator  of  $1.90  per  day,  is <br />practically  non-existent,  as  basic  social  services  such  as  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation  are complemented by a comprehensive  welfare system6. This contributes to its high rank in the Human <br />Development Index, 2015: 64th out of 187 countries, the  second highest in Africa.  However, recent <br />poverty studies7 reveal an increasing number of people below the national  poverty line (17 % <br />below  $3.2  per  day  at  2012  prices)  and  increasing  inequality  (Gini  coefficient  of  0.6588),  with <br />fisheries, agricultural sectors, and women-headed households the most impoverished9. Although the <br />welfare  system  has  contributed  to  the  elimination of  extreme  poverty,  analysis  indicates  that <br />leakages  in  the  system  (with  only  15  per  cent  estimated  to  be  reaching  the  real  needs  of  the  poor) impede the swift eradication of residual poverty.   <br />5. The  poverty  studies  highlight  a  growing  trend  of  the  middle  class slipping  into  poverty, <br />identifying nearly 40 % of the population (per-adult equivalent $9.7 per day) as poor, and 24.3 <br />percent  as  suffering  from  food  insecurity  (per-adult  equivalent  of  $7.9  per  day)10.  Data  from  the National  Bureau  of  Statistics  suggest  that  lack  of  income  is  not  in  itself  the  root  cause  of  poverty among some  segments of the  population, but that impoverishment  may be  a  result of poor lifestyle choices  and  weaknesses  in  livelihoods  due  relative  inactivity  in  the  prime  working-age  group  of those below the poverty line, especially men. </p><p><strong>HDR: </strong><a href=\"https://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/SYC\"><strong>https://hdr.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/SYC#</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>2- Human Development Index (HDI) </strong></p><p>Seychelles\u2019 HDI value for 2019 is 0.796\u2014 which put the country in the high human development category\u2014 positioning it at 67 out of 189 countries and territories.
