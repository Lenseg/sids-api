As  a  small  island  developing  state,  S\u00e3o  Tom\u00e9  and  Pr\u00edncipe  (population  193,712)  is  particularly vulnerable to climate change. The country\u2019s economy revolves around agriculture and fishing, which employ 19% of the population (25% of men and 8% of women),  and  both  are  highly  vulnerable  to  climate  change. Small-scale  farmers,  traders  of agricultural  products  (women  and  young  girls)  and  fisherfolk  are  the  most  vulnerable.  </p><p>The Transformation Agenda 2030 for S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe is based on the country\u2019s \u2018Vision S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe 2030: The country we need to build\u2019 calls for optimizing the potential of these two sectors to tackle poverty, increase economic growth and green employment opportunities, and reduce the negative impact of  climate  change.  The  country\u2019s  partners  are  helping  to  develop  interventions  to  manage  disasters; for example, the World Bank is supporting coastal zone management. S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe  has  important  hydropower  potential,  providing  an  opportunity  to  increase  renewable energy production and reduce government expenditure on imported fuel for electricity.</p>"}, "successesInDevelopment": {"title": "Successes in Development", "content": "<p>S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, classified as lower middle income, achieved an estimated 5 per cent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. This was due to increased public investments (financed through official development assistance), recovery of cocoa production and the projected increase in foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. </p><p>The Transformation Agenda aims to boost good governance and public sector reform; promote sustainable and inclusive growth; strengthen human capital and social services delivery; and bolster social cohesion and social protection. To promote rapid economic growth and equitable development, the Government has prioritized (a) consolidating the rule of law and deepening democracy; (b) achieving sustainable growth; (c) promoting human development; and (d) fostering positive values and behaviors nationwide to promote successful development. </p><p>Interventions  against  endemic  diseases  have  been  very  effective.

Despite  average  GDP  growth of over 4% since 2012, poverty has not declined significantly. Around two thirds of the adult population lives below the national poverty line \u2013 71.3% of women and 63.4% of men. Access to economic opportunities is skewed, as shown by the unemployment rates of 19.7% for women and 9.3% for men and the economic activity rate of 51%  for  women  and  75%  for  men.  The unemployment  rate  among  young  people  aged 15-24 is 23%, compared to the global average of 13% in 2015. 3. Employment  figures  are  low  due  to  poor  economic  diversification  \u2013  for  instance,  cocoa exports  contribute  95%  of  a  trade  balance, always  in  deficit.</p><p>Many  citizens  have  benefited  minimally  or  not  at  all  from  the  country\u2019s  development, and environmental vulnerability  has  exacerbated  poverty  in  certain  regions.  These  issues  are compounded  by inadequate  social  protection.  The  deficient  rule  of  law  impedes  economic  growth, resource mobilization and development management. The justice system is weak and largely inaccessible  for  vulnerable  groups,  particularly  women  and  poor  people.  The  uneven  income distribution leads to variable economic growth. </p><p>In S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe appropriate solutions for adaptation to climate change do exist.
