It is located, in the intertropical convergence climate zone of the northwest coast of Africa. The country's surface totals 32,125 sq. km, of which at least 22% is composed by water. The country is divided into a continental and an insular part, which is home to the Bijago\u0301s Archipelago, comprising 88 islands and islets, of which 21 are inhabited. Guinea-Bissau is also home to a dense network of river basins, including some international ones (such as the Geba-Kayanga river and the Corubal-Koliba river).</p><p>Much of the country\u2019s land surface is in lowlands: the highest point in the country is 298 meters above sea level, and 19% to 24% of the country's land surface has altitudes of up to 10m. Tropical and subtropical forests, savannas and shrubs dominate most of the land areas, while large expanses of mangroves are concentrated in the coastal zone, covering 22% of the country's Influenced by both the seasonality of the monsoon rains and the dry Harmattan winds, Guinea- Bissau's climate is warm all year round, with an average temperature of 26.3\u00b0C. The country has a relatively high level of rainfall, ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 mm per year in the coastal zone, to 1,000 to 1,500 mm in the interior. Almost all rainfall occurs between June and September/October. From December to April, the country experiences droughts.</p><p>Guinea-Bissau is a country rich in biodiversity (including coastal/marine and terrestrial biodiversity) and it has significant natural resources which have by and large not yet been explored. Currently, 26% of the national territory is located within protected areas that play an important role in maintaining these natural resources, as well as important ecosystem services, such as potential carbon sequestration.</p><p>With a population of nearly 2.0 million inhabitants, growing at a rate of 2.5% per year, Guinea- Bissau is one of the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world. More than half of the population is urban and 42% are under 15 (2019). Life expectancy at birth has improved, going from 55 years in 2010 to 58 years in 2019. Because of these and other socioeconomic indicators, Guinea-Bissau has a very weak Human Development Index (HDI), positioning the country as a 177th out of 189 countries in the current UNDP world ranking.</p><p>The economy is based on non-mechanized agriculture, fishing, cashew nut exports, informal trade, and foreign aid, on which the government of Guinea-Bissau still depends to a large extent. According to the World Bank, GDP per capita has dropped from $802 in 2018 to $727 in 2020 (both in current USD and showing a 9.3% drop in 2 years). This drop is, on the one hand, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other, due to the unfavorable economic environment and political instability.</p><p>Agriculture is the country's most dominant economic sector, accounting for an average of 84% of export earnings between 2016 and 2018, alongside fisheries.</p><p>80% of the working population. The export of cashew nuts has already placed Guinea-Bissau as the 7th largest exporter in the world in 2017. In that year, cashew nut exports yielded more than $255M to Guinea-Bissau in gross foreign revenues, mainly due to a spike in the product's price in the international market. Despite strong international demand, production did not increase, or it increased very little. Since the price of cashew nut peaked in 2017, the contribution of this <em>commodity </em>to export earnings decreased significantly. Other products, such as gold and timber, became part of Guinea-Bissau's export products\u2019 portfolio. Historically, the primary sectors (agriculture, forests, and fisheries) came to represent an average of 44% of GDP between 2001</p><p>Both sectors employ more thanand 2017. More recently, the services sector has grown and today represents around 45% of GDP, followed mainly by the agri-food industry (15%).</p><p>After three consecutive years of sustained growth (on average 6% over 2015-2017) which was able to put an end to the long period of stagnation (2000-2014), the Bissau-Guinean economy\u2019s growth slowed significantly in 2018 at a rate of 3.8%, due to the drop in both production (-25%) and the international price of cashew nuts. In 2019, economic growth accelerated, registering a rate of 4.5%. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy contracted recording a decrease of -2.4%.</p><p>On the longer term, the IMF forecasts an average annual growth of 5%, thanks to public investment spending in major road and energy infrastructure. Nevertheless, the reversal in the price of cashew nuts and the political situation could constitute a major risk that could slow down this growth.</p><p><strong>2.1 Socioeconomic Vulnerability Baseline</strong></p><p>There is an important non-climate vulnerability in Guinea-Bissau's national circumstances to be considered. Less than half of the adult population can read and write (45.6% of adults over 15 years old, and 30.7% for women). More than two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line (of less than USD 1.90 a day). Many suffer chronically from food insecurity, at a population rate that varies between 11% and 51%, depending on the year and region. At a local level, cashew cultivation can compete with food production in the context of family subsistence farming3, except in regions unsuitable for cashew cultivation, where, for example, mangrove rice predominates. This, in turn, competes with imported rice and makes it difficult to maintain strategic cereal banks in the country, creating problems about food security. Shocks caused by irregular rainfall, together with price fluctuations for imported rice and cashew nuts, further aggravate the chronic food insecurity in Guinea-Bissau.</p><p>Key economic sectors such as transport, industry, infrastructure, water resources, health and energy production are still largely underdeveloped in Guinea-Bissau. Investments in the productive sectors, human capital and technology are insufficient. Climate change tends to seriously aggravate pre-existing vulnerability in Guinea-Bissau, affecting both the population and economic and ecosystem assets. Climate change also makes it difficult to consolidate the benefits of development in the country.</p><p><strong>2.2 Energy, Forests &amp; Biodiversity</strong></p><p>Access to energy is a major social, economic, and environmental issue for Guinea- Bissau.Thecountry'selectrification rateis still low, not exceeding 45% in 2020, and the government plans to raise it to 80% in 2030. The country suffers from the insufficiency of its infrastructure, particularly the public grid, supplying only a small part of national needs, with a focus on the capital.</p><p>Primary energy consumption is still dominated by biomass, which accounts for over 80% of the country's primary energy demand. This is one of the most important deforestation drivers in Guinea-Bissau, alongside shifting agriculture based on slash-and-burn techniques. This is an important issue for the country in terms of its energy matrix and the costs of energy production, noting that Guinea-Bissau imports fossil fuels to meet its needs and access to modern energy, for which there is a large, suppressed demand.</p><p>Guinea-Bissau's forests, the ecosystem services that they provide, and the country's biodiversity are of critical importance to the economy and to local populations. At the same time, this biodiversity is under threat, even within protected areas, such as the Cantanhez National Park,</p><p>which is home to the few remnants of dense forest in Guinea-Bissau. On the one hand, protected areas act as a magnet in eyes of loggers. On the other, they fulfil their role in helping slow down deforestation. Addressing climate challenges in the forest and biodiversity sectors is critical for Guinea-Bissau in its efforts to make an effective national contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Although the protected areas are proportionally large (having increased from 15% to 26% of the country's surface in 2010), practically all of them harbor resident population. At the same time, studies by IBAP have shown that pressure exerted on natural resources by the local population is less within protected areas than in areas where land use is not regulated. For example, in 2013, while the country was experiencing a vacuum in the inspection of the forest sector, the loss of forests peaked and has continued to accelerate since then, due to the illegal logging of hardwoods. Logging within protected areas happens at a smaller scale than outside.</p><p>Currently, investments in conservation in Guinea-Bissau are limited and vary between $2.0M to $3.0M per year \u2013 making biodiversity, forests and ecosystem services vulnerable \u2018sectors\u2019. At the same time, these sectors are key to building resilience in the country and to controlling GHG emissions. Due to the indiscriminate logging in forest areas, which was intense in 2013, and then stabilized at a high level from 2014 on, the role of deforestation in the country's total GHG emissions contributed to changing Guinea-Bissau from being a carbon sink to becoming a net emitter of CO2.</p>"}}, "KeyStats": [{"value": 58.4, "title": "Poverty rate", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 1367.0, "title": "Gross national income (GNI) per capita", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 1.2, "title": "gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 5.0, "title": "access clean fuels and technology ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 26.0, "title": "Access to electricity ", "unit": "%"}, {"value": 0.48, "title": "Human development index", "unit": ""}, {"value": 0.372, "title": "Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)", "unit": ""}, {"value": 70.4, "title": "Land area covered by forest ", "unit": "%"}]}
