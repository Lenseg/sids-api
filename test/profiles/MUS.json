The total land area of the Republic of Mauritius is 2040 km2. It is surrounded by coral reefs and is situated at about 2000 km off the East coast of Africa. In Mauritius, key socio-economic sectors which are most likely to be affected by climate change and sea level rise are: coastal resources, agriculture, water resources, fisheries, health and well-being, land use change and forestry and biodiversity.</p><p>The Marine Exclusive Economic Zone of the Republic of Mauritius is about 2 million km2. Mauritius  has  been  benefiting  from  the  ocean  economy  with substantial ocean-related economic activities. Mauritius is working to protect the balance between  sustaining  economic  growth  and  ensuring  terrestrial,  coastal,  and  marine  environmental sustainability  through  its  ocean  governance  practices.  Coastal  areas  are  facing  increasing  marine and  terrestrial  environmental  pressures,  with  coral  cover  currently  at  only  30 percent,  down from 60% a decade ago. Since marine protected areas are not being actively managed, there is an urgent need for action.

Most  notably,  the  income  of  the  bottom  40% of  the population has been growing at an annual rate of 1.8% compared to 3.1% for the rest of  the  population,  indicating  that  prosperity  is  not  equally  shared  as  growth  dynamics  are  tilted toward  high-skilled  services  sectors  and  against  the  most  vulnerable  and  uneducated. Wage income  is the  main driver of prosperity in Mauritius, yet the  most vulnerable struggle to reap the benefits  of  economic  growth,  as  not  enough  employment  is  created  and  many  workers  lack adequate  skills  for  the  current  labour  market.  Consequently,  extreme  poverty, though  still  low,  is rising: 0.4% in 2007 and 1.4% in 20148. </p><p>In 2012, women were more likely to be in relative poverty, at 10.5% (66,700) against 9.0% (56,000) for males. Poverty is highly concentrated among children and youth, which has  implications  for  inclusion  and  intergenerational  transmission  of  poverty.  Challenges  for gender  equality  include  under-representation  of  women  in  parliament  (12%) and  on corporate  boards  (5.6  per  cent),  and  low  activity  rates  (45.3% against  75.2%  of men). 24% of women have experienced gender-based violence.
