Around three quarters of the labour force works in the informal economy, primarily subsistence farming and fishing. Most of the islands are built on coral and are not suitable for crop production beyond household needs. Underemployment, particularly of young people, is fuelling urbanisation of the capital, Funafuti.</p><p>Due to its low-lying geography, Tuvalu is at acute risk from natural disasters, including rising storm surges, cyclones, and tsunamis. Seawater infiltration has already increased soil salinity, limiting the range of plants that can be grown on the islands. Increased water temperatures and ocean acidification have affected coral ecosystems that serve as fish nurseries, making it harder for Tuvaluans to catch and eat fish. Groundwater resources are no longer suitable for human consumption due to pollution from saltwater intrusion. Coastal erosion is a major problem in Tuvalu, particularly on the western side of the islands. As most Tuvaluans live within coastal areas, additional stress is being placed on the already vulnerable marine ecosystem. Rising sea temperatures are also contributing to coral bleaching and decreasing marine productivity. The marine ecosystem is a vital component of Tuvalu\u2019s economy which is dependent on revenue provided by tuna fishing.</p><p><strong>////////////////////////////Compiled Content////////////////////////////////</strong></p><p><strong>TUVALU</strong></p><p><strong>UNDP in Tuvalu</strong></p><p><strong>Inclusive service delivery</strong></p><p>We help countries address a range of policy and institutional bottlenecks to ensure more inclusive service delivery, focusing on issues facing women, youth and vulnerable groups. We draw on our comparative advantage and experiences in supporting the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals Acceleration Frameworks to support localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1, 5, 8, 10 and 17. At the country level, we target the alignment of national and sectoral plans and multi-year results-based budgets, exploring all potential sources of revenue through development finance assessment aimed at optimizing and increasing the collection and use of finance for national priorities.</p><p><strong>Innovation</strong></p><p>We assist the countries in identifying innovative technological solutions to build national data ecosystems for evidence-based policymaking using disaggregated data. We work closely with the United Nations and regional partners engaged in data generation, such as UNFPA, UNICEF and the Pacific Community, through national and sample surveys. The data is used to track progress towards national priorities and their links to regional and global development priorities, identify groups to target and analyse and formulate evidence-based policy formulation and SDG Acceleration Frameworks.</p><p><strong>Triangular and south-south cooperation\u00a0</strong></p><p>In keeping with Goal 17, the support fosters South-South and Triangular Cooperation and implementation of the Pacific SDG Roadmap, the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, the SAMOA Pathway and other regional and international instruments and partnership mechanisms.\u00a0<br /><br />We work with regional organizations, governments, private sector, civil society and United Nations partners to strengthen institutional arrangements and change behaviours to promote equal influence and participation of women and youth in priority-setting and implementation of activities at all levels. Countries are encouraged to establish measures that ensure the consistent engagement of communities in rural areas and outer islands, faith-based groups and the private sector in the design and delivery of essential public services. As part of an integrated, risk informed development approach, we help countries and communities integrate risk assessment and adaptation measures into planning processes at all levels to address vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Promote blue economies</strong></p><p>Responding to the changing face of poverty and hardship in the Pacific, we promote the concept of blue/green economies to help countries establish an enabling environment for private sector initiatives that create jobs for women, men and youth, recognizing the vast economic benefits of marine and land ecosystems while ensuring their sustainable management. To that end, we scale up successful initiatives such as organic farming, fisheries, ecotourism and farm-to-table business models, especially targeting marginalized urban youth. Building on past support to the informal sector, we promote opportunities for employment, incomes and matching investment in social enterprises that tackle community-based improvement projects such as resilient village infrastructure and waste management. To promote access to finance, we scale up a range of inclusive financial services targeting low income women and men in rural areas.</p><p><strong>40% CITIZEN PARTICIPATION Through UNDP, Tuvalu's constitutional reform process was participatory with 40% of Tuvaluans involved in shaping their constitution.
