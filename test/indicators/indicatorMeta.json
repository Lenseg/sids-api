"category": "Indicators", "indicator": "Projected change of agricultural cereal yield", "dim": "raw", "units": "%", "def": "Description: Projected amount that climate change is predicted to change food supply by mid-century for three staples: rice, wheat and maize. The projections of the yield productions are obtained from five crop models (EPIC, GEPIC, LPJmL, pDSSAT, PEGASUS), and it assumes effect of CO2 fertilization but does not adjust for changes in farming systems or irrigation. \nRationale: Rosenzweig, et al. (2013) compared results from seven crop models against agricultural impacts of climate change expressed by yield changes through the end of the century. ND-GAIN includes the average impacts on three crops (rice, wheat and maize) as an indication of the climate impacts on agriculture sector and food supply because these three crops make up two thirds of human food consumption (FAO). Calculation: The projected change is calculated by the percent change from the baseline projection of annual average of actual cereal yield in 1980-2009 to a future projection in 2040-2069 under the RCP4.5 emission scenario(about RCP emission scenarios see IPCC, 2014).

Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND-GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value.

The projected change of annual runoff due to climate change takes into account impacts on precipitation, evaporation, transpiration and soil moisture, which are the key factors impacting volume of runoffs(N\u011bmec & 16 Schaake, 1982). ND-GAIN uses the projected change of annual runoff as a proxy to measure the climate impacts to surface water resources. Calculation: The projected change is the percent change in annual runoff from the baseline projection (1980-2009) to the future projection (2040-2069) using RCP4.5 emission scenario. Some baselines are close to zero, causing large percent changes even though the future projection is still low. To offset this effect, ND-GAIN sets all baseline flows to a set minimum value. The calculation here sets the 10 percentile to be the minimum value. Baseline and future projections are generated by averaging annual runoffs from six GCMs. ", "source": "Projected change of water risks by Aqueduct, World Resource Institute", "subcategory": "Water", "link": "https://gain.nd.edu/", "dataset": "ndgain", "numYears": 26.0, "numCountries": 165.0, "# SIDS": 13.0, "priority": "4.0", "yearValueCounts": {"2010": "165", "2011": "165", "2012": "165", "2013": "165", "2014": "165", "2015": "165", "2016": "165", "2017": "165", "2018": "165", "2019": "165", "2020": "165", "2004": "165", "2005": "165", "2006": "165", "2007": "165", "2008": "165", "2009": "165", "2000": "165", "2002": "165", "2003": "165", "1995": "165", "1996": "165", "1997": "165", "1998": "165", "1999": "165", "2001": "165"}}, "ndgain-id_wate_02-raw": {"indicatorCode": "ndgain-id_wate_02-raw", "category": "Indicators", "indicator": "Projected change of annual groundwater recharge (GWR)", "dim": "raw", "units": "%", "def": "Description: An indication of how climate change will bring changes on annual groundwater resource by mid century.

We therefore assigned the issue category a modest weight of 5% of the policy objective. As our confidence in the metrics supporting Waste Management grows, we expect its weight may increase. The balance of indicators come from IHME and are measured in Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) rates (see Chapters 4\u201a\u00c4\u00ec6). Aggregated to a global level, we find that the majority of DALYs lost are due to air pollution and, within that suite of risks, to ambient particulate matter (PM2. 5), which receive the greatest weights among the issue categories and indicators, respectively.

According to the Planetary Boundaries model (Rockstr\u221a\u2202m et al., 2009), the two leading threats to the environment are biodiversity loss and climate change. Biodiversity loss is largely captured in our Biodiversity & Habitat issue category (25%), though the indicators in Ecosystem Services (10%) and Fisheries (10%) also reflect threats to this planetary boundary.

The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS. The list of keywords includes generic ocean terms, keywords related to off-shore oil and gas, maritime transport, maritime fisheries and the ocean economy more broadly. See the following table for the full list. While entries in the programme name and description fields occasionally appear in their original language, all of these occurrences are consistently translated into English thus removing the necessity to devise foreign language keywords in the dictionary</p><p><strong>Keywords to identify a candidate subset of ocean-related FFS measures</strong></p><table><tr><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Search terms</th><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ocean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marine</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">maritime</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">offshore</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">reef</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-water</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-bed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">benthic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">lagoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mudflat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tidal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mangrove</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coast*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wetland</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marshsalt</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marsh</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">salt-water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">brackish</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">fish*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquaculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mariculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cod</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tuna</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mussels</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oysters</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">crustacean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mollusc</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">pelagic</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-food</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquatic plants</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">shipping</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship-building</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">boat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">vessel</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ferry</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">floating</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">naval</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbor</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dock</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea transport</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cargo</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ballast</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oil spill*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oceanogra*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">touris*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dredg*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea salt</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">desali*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">typhoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">flood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">biotechnology</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">robotics</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wave</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">underwater vehicle</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">continental shelf</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">EEZ</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">exclusive economic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">arctic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">piracy</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">submarine</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">undersea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cable*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">seabed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">international water*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">rig</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">territorial sea</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">high sea*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr></table><p>Third, additional measures may be identified using the <em>sector</em> dimension which labels individual measures following the nomenclature used in the IEA World Energy Balances.

The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS.

The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS. The list of keywords includes generic ocean terms, keywords related to off-shore oil and gas, maritime transport, maritime fisheries and the ocean economy more broadly. See the following table for the full list. While entries in the programme name and description fields occasionally appear in their original language, all of these occurrences are consistently translated into English thus removing the necessity to devise foreign language keywords in the dictionary</p><p><strong>Keywords to identify a candidate subset of ocean-related FFS measures</strong></p><table><tr><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Search terms</th><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ocean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marine</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">maritime</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">offshore</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">reef</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-sea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">deep-water</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-bed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">benthic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">lagoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mudflat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tidal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mangrove</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coast*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wetland</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coastal</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marshsalt</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">marsh</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">salt-water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">brackish</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">fish*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquaculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mariculture</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cod</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tuna</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">coral*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mussels</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oysters</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">crustacean</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">mollusc</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">pelagic</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-food</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">aquatic plants</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">shipping</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ship-building</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">boat</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">vessel</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ferry</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">floating</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">naval</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea-port</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">harbor</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dock</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea transport</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cargo</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">ballast</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oil spill*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">oceanogra*</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">tour</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">touris*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">dredg*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">sea salt</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">desali*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">typhoon</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">flood</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">biotechnology</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">robotics</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">wave</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">underwater vehicle</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">continental shelf</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">EEZ</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">exclusive economic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">arctic</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">piracy</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">submarine</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">undersea</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cable*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">seabed</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">hurricane</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cyclone</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">blue water</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">cruise</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">international water*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">rig</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">territorial sea</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">high sea*</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" /></tr></table><p>Third, additional measures may be identified using the <em>sector</em> dimension which labels individual measures following the nomenclature used in the IEA World Energy Balances.

The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS.

The Inventory currently covers 36 OECD member countries and eight partner economies (Brazil, Colombia, China, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and South Africa) and has compiled more than 1 100 individual support measures (both active and terminated ones). In addition to national measures, subnational support measures for selected economies are also covered (i.e., Australia, Canada, China, Germany and the US).</p><p>For each measure two types of information are provided: (i) fiscal information on the budgetary transfers or tax expenditures (monetary value) and (ii) textual metadata about a measure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beneficiaries, eligibility criteria, historical background, and any relevant data on procurement and processing information.</p><p>Following the OECD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PSE-CSE framework the measures benefitting fossil fuel producers are classified as the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) while those that benefit individual fossil fuel consumers are classified under the Consumer Support Estimate (CSE). A third category, the General Services Support Estimate (GSSE), is assigned for measures that do not currently increase fossil fuel production and consumption but may do so in the future.</p><p>The Inventory identifies the type of fossil fuels benefitted by each measure and presents a breakdown of the amount of support by assigning fuel type tags. In cases where this breakdown is not available in official government sources, the OECD performs data transformation procedure to allocate support to individual fuel tags according to the relative value of production or consumption as calculated from the IEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s World Energy Balances database. Note that measures can benefit more than one type of fossil fuel at the same time and can thus receive multiple fuel tags in this respect. For example, a measure granting lower sales tax rates for road transport fuels will receive multiple fuel tags such as motor gasoline, diesel, LPG and natural gas.</p><p>Building on this methodology, an additional binary tag is developed for ocean-related government support for fossil fuels. </p><h4>Search strategy to identify ocean-related measures</h4><p>First, measures in countries not bounded by a coastline are removed (Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovak Republic and Switzerland).</p><p>Second, a keyword search is conducted on both the programme name and description to pre-screen measures and identify potential candidates for ocean-related FFS.

Main activity producers (formerly known as public utilities) are defined as those undertakings whose primary activity is to supply the public. They may be publicly or privately owned. This corresponds to IPCC Source/Sink Category 1 A 1 a. For the CO2 emissions from fuel combustion (summary) file, emissions from own on-site use of fuel in power plants (EPOWERPLT) are also included. (2) Unallocated Autoproducers which contains the emissions from the generation of electricity and/or heat by autoproducers. Autoproducers are defined as undertakings that generate electricity and/or heat, wholly or partly for their own use as an activity which supports their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. In the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, these emissions would normally be distributed between industry, transport and \"other\" sectors. (3) Other Energy Industries contains emissions from fuel combusted in petroleum refineries, for the manufacture of solid fuels, coal mining, oil and gas extraction and other energy-producing industries. This corresponds to the IPCC Source/Sink Categories 1 A 1 b and 1 A 1 c. According to the 1996 IPCC Guidelines, emissions from coke inputs to blast furnaces can either be counted here or in the Industrial Processes source/sink category. Within detailed sectoral calculations, certain non-energy processes can be distinguished. In the reduction of iron in a blast furnace through the combustion of coke, the primary purpose of the coke oxidation is to produce pig iron and the emissions can be considered as an industrial process.
